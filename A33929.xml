            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT's the ſaying of the Wiſe man. <hi>Prov. 4. 5. Get wiſdom, get underſtanding, forget it not.</hi> v. <hi>7.

And to underſtanding, rather to be choſen than ſilver?</hi> Then ſurely it is not wiſdom to get gold and ſilver, but that which is far above it. <hi>Which will give to thine head</hi>

            <p>They are the great things of Divine wiſdom (as revealed in the Scriptures of truth) that I have been exerciſed about, and of which it's ſaid <hi>2 Tim. 3. 15.

            <p>Though with ſome their Studies may be much (if not too much) about things of a lower and terrene concern (as indeed all things are, beneath <hi>the glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God)</hi> yet I doubt not the lawfulneſs of endeavours for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments in human learning, and that both as to the Languages <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Your learned and Philoſophical ſtudies may tend to make you men of parts, and of uſe among men, in things of torrene concern, if not abuſed, and if kept ſubject in its place, may prove no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to you (but a help) in your Divine ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, though I acknowledge not Philoſophy to be the Mother of Theology, as ſome ſay. <hi>Gal. 4. 26.</hi> yet this I dare ſay, that without rational Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy (in its root) we could not be rational men, and then we could not be Chriſtian men without a miracle indeed (as ſome ſay) it being to the rational underſtanding part in man that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel comes, and by which it's underſtood and believed.</p>

                        </gap> Rom. 10. 6, 7, 8, 9.</hi> to thoſe who believe the Scripture to be the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, it's rational (as well as divine) to believe God in his word, and love and cleave to him therein (which is the great and ſaving Faith of the Goſpel) though over and above our rational capacities. He has of his own grace or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Goſpel (which is the Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof) to be the Miniſtration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; <hi>2 Cor. 3. 8.</hi> and to miniſter the Spirit for our help therein; <hi>Gal. 3. 2. Rom. 8. 26.</hi> yet, its ſo far from the Goſpel to deſtroy our rational and moral capacities, that it tends to help and lighten us therein, though in a more Spiritual and ſublime way.</p>
                  <p>Some talk of loſing (or laying aſide) our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as if Chriſtianity were an irrational thing; if we lay aſide our reaſon, we muſt lay aſide our
<pb facs="tcp:61328:5"/> humanity, and our Chriſtianity too. Others talk of reaſons being ſanctified, and that I like well, it ſtands with the truth of the Goſpel, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſanctified by the word and ſpirit of the Goſpel. <hi>Joh. 17. 17. Sanctifie them through the truth, thy word is truth.</hi> chap. 15. 3. Pſ. 119. 9. and I underſtand reaſon then to be ſanctified, when it underſtands, believes, loves and obeys the truth of the Goſpel, which I take to be regeneration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun here, which being perſevered in, will iſſue in the perfect Regeneration in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>But I am afraid that under the notion of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied reaſon, two evils are come in upon Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity like a torrent, even to the ſpoiling thereof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some under the notion of the Spirit and ſanctified reaſon, do out and end the greateſt part of the <hi>glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God,</hi> in the great matters of Faith, narrowing and denying thereof in the largeneſs of its extent, contrary to the very letter and ſcope of Scripture, alone from their ſuppoſed ſanctified reaſon, as will appear in the following diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And others make additions, and change the Ordinances according to their own devices, and all, by ſuppoſed ſanctified reaſon, corrupted Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and vain deceit, <hi>after the will of men and not after Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Chriſtian religion in it ſelf, as it's the moſt
<pb facs="tcp:61328:6"/> divine, ſo its he moſtrational Religion in the world, or that ever was in the world, being opened to us by the Divine Revelation, though there are ſome things in it above the reach of reaſon to comprehend, even with the Divine Revelation and Teachings of God therein, yet we may underſtand the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and it's rational for us to believe it, becauſe God has ſaid it; to inſtance in ſome particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God ſhould ſo love the world, as to give his only begotten Son for its redemption, and Chriſt ſo love the world, as to give his Fleſh for the life thereof, are incomprehenſible myſteries of grace. <hi>Joh. 3. 16. &amp; 6. 51. Eph. 3. 17, 18, 19.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Incarnation of our bleſſed Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt is in it ſelf an incomprehenſible myſtery. <hi>1 Tim. 3. 16.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Reſurrection, Judgment, the greatneſs, terribleneſs, righteouſneſs and juſtice thereof, the reſtitution, new world, with the diverſities of the glories and puniſhments thereof, are all incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible myſteries till the times come of effecting thereof, <hi>1 Cor. 13. 9. 10. 1 Joh. 3. 2. Pſ. 9. 11.</hi> yet by the Divine Revelation we may underſtand the truth of theſe unſearchable myſteries, and it's very rational as well as divine, that we believe the truth thereof.</p>
                  <p>So that I ſay, the Chriſtian Faith and Religion is the moſt rational, and to render it unreaſonable
<pb facs="tcp:61328:6"/> in any of the parts thereof, does open wrong to God, Chriſt, the Goſpel, and to men: When in truth, in its own ſimplicity and purity, there is nothing irrational in it; in this matter, we may and muſt ſay (if we ſay right) as <hi>Prov. 8. 8, 9. All the words of wiſdoms mouth are righteous, there is nothing froward or perverſe in them, they are all plain to him that underſtandeth, and right to them that find knowledge</hi> &amp; ch. 14. 16. a ſcorner ſeeketh wiſdom and findeth it not, but knowledge is eaſie to him that hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
                  <p>God having given to men large Capacities, that if rightly exerciſed about the works of God and word of life, they might attain to the excellent knowledge of the moſt holy, and to the precious faith and life of the Goſpel, through the Divine teachings therein, which ſhall not be wanting to thoſe that really deſire and ſeek it; <hi>Prov. 2. 1.</hi> to <hi>6. Luk. 11. 13. Jam. 1. 5.</hi> God having in his wiſdom and grace ſtated the things of the Goſpel both in matters of Faith and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, plain to the rational Capacities of men, to the end that they might (through a right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry) obtain the ſaving knowledge of his will therein.</p>
                  <p>And its only the irrational devices, additions, and contrary interpretations of men (both in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb facs="tcp:61328:7"/> of Faith and practice) that hath filled the world with irrational errours, diviſions, and confuſions, which the Scripture (if cleaved to, in its own light and language, which is but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſhould be ſo, as well as divine) would be the alone bleſſed way for us to arrive to unity in the great things of Goſpel concern, reaſon miſled by Tradition, Blind-zeal, or captivated by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual luſts, has and doth make bad work in the world. See from Scripture how reaſon and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion unites.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It's both rational as well as Religious that we believe God in the word of his grace. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 2. where unbelievers are rendred to be unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable men, as well as irreligious, and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15. we are <hi>to give a reaſon of our hope, to every one that ſhall ask.</hi> Which can never be, if our reaſon be uſeleſs, nor can meerly rational men underſtand it when it is given them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It's rational, as well as Religious, that we ſhould ſerve and worſhip God according to his own revealed will in the Goſpel, and not after our own wills, or the inventions and Traditions of men. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. 2. the contrary is irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, as well as irreligious.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The increaſe of divine grace (received by faith in the Goſpel) is by the rational exerciſe of our ſelves therein. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 29. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 14.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb facs="tcp:61328:7"/>4. The holy and honourable terms of the Goſpel, on which the life and glory thereof is promiſed, and without which we may not expect it, renders it to be very rational and credible to men, no man in his right reaſon can conclude that God ſhould ſeek to ſave a people in ſo wonderful away, but in the way of holineſs, the contrary would render the Goſpel incredible to all rational men.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It's rational, as well as Religious that we abhor all moral evils, ſenſual and brutiſh luſts, and to love all moral vertues and duties, and the contrary is irrational and immoral, as well as irreligious. The Moral law, or Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> is commonly underſtood to be the ſame for ſubſtance as is written in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or rational and moral Philoſophy in men. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. Which the Goſpel deſtroys not, but tends to perfect it in us, as it's adminiſtred to us by Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 31. and 8. 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 21. not as from mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> but as from mount <hi>Sion. Heb.</hi> 2. 18. 22. the ſum and ſubſtance of the Law and Prophets is to teach men <hi>to love God above all, and their neighbours as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to do to others, as they would they ſhould do to them,</hi> and the Goſpel teaches the ſame <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 37. to 40. and 7. 12. and this is written in all men by nature, and is true rational and moral Philoſophy, and true Goſpel Divinity, and
<pb facs="tcp:61328:8"/> where it's not effected, it's by the ſouls captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by irrational, immoral, and ſenſual luſts; and how would the Divine Law of Chriſt, and in the Goſpel united to our underſtandings and reaſon, effect it, if taken heed unto: A ſin and ſhame it is, (and dreadful will be the iſſue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) that many Learned men who account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves above others, both in Philoſophy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and yet are more immoral than many moral Heathens. And as both moral Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy and Goſpel Divinity unites in teaching the abhorrency of all ungodlineſs, with the practice of all the contrary vertues and duties, ſo would it teach us to abhor all perſecution for Conſcience ſake, if attended to, it would teach us in this matter, to do to others, as we would they ſhould do to us; the contrary being not only unchriſtian, but irrational. No man in his right reaſon would be content to be forced to believe and worſhip God as others do, contrary to his own light and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſuch in Juſtice, reaſon it ſelf, and light of nature abhors; and it's likewiſe contrary to the Proteſtant Doctrine and Faith, which is, to make the Scriptures our rule in all matters of Faith and practice, and not to be compelled to believe as the Church believeth, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by Proteſtants to be the Popiſh Faith, and not the Faith of Chriſt.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:61328:8"/>
                  <p>And ſtrange it ſeems to be, that Learned men who profeſs themſelves to have moſt, both of Philoſophy and Divinity, ſhould be ſo great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriers herein: I think it may be ſaid (without all juſt occaſion of offence) that throughout all ages of Chriſtianity, Learned men has lien at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of moſt of the perſecutions for Conſcience ſake, ſurely it came not from their Philoſophy or Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but from their enmity, pride, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, Pſ. 10. 2. or from ſome carnal and corrupt ends, within themſelves muſt be irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and irreligious, or at beſt from blind and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant zeal, <hi>Joh. 16. 2. Phi.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
                  <p>It's true the Scripture warns us to take heed <hi>of being ſpoiled by Philoſophy and vain deceit after the traditions of men, and the rudiments of the World, and not after Chriſt, Col. 2. 8, i. e.</hi> When our reaſon turns us aſide from the Goſpel either in matters of Faith or practice, being corruptly exerciſed, and ſo becomes vain and deceitful, and is not pure reaſon, that ſubmits it ſelf to the Divine Law of Chriſt in all things ſo far as it underſtands it.</p>
                  <p>And although Rational and Moral Philoſophy was (and yet is) excellent in its time and place, and in itſelf (in its degree) ſpiritual, being of (and from) God (yet the Goſpel is more ſpiritual) and by it, men formerly arrived to much of the
<pb facs="tcp:61328:9"/> knowledge of God and themſelves, and ſo to a good life in moral virtues, (and yet might arrive to the ſame) and doubtleſs were then accepted of God, and may yet be ſo, where the Goſpel is not known, yet where the Goſpel comes it will not ſerve or avail us without the true faith and life of the Goſpel, but if it (being captivated by ſenſual luſts) reject or neglect the Grace of life; it renders ſuch the more liable to the Judgment and damnation threatned therein.</p>

                  <p>The Reaſons of my dedicating the enſuing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian diſcourſe unto you, are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the things, diſcourſed on, are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great (if not of greateſt) concern, to the name of God and Chriſt, the glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God, and the ſpiritual and eternal good of men, and therefore of weightteſt concern to have the precedency in your meditations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe moſt of the things diſcourſed on are not Novel, but the controverted things of the paſt and preſent times, the Doctrine of the Sovereignty of God, as exerciſed towards men, the Doctrine of Election and reprobation, the general and ſpecial grace of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being the ſubſtance of the diſcourſe, and that on which all depends. The eighth chapter may at firſt (probably) with ſome, ſeem moſt difficult, yet I doubt not, but is
<pb facs="tcp:61328:9"/> founded in, and fully comports with the univerſal deſign of God, and undertaking of Chriſt in the general grace to the World, in the reſtitution and world to come, in times to be effected, and ſeems to be of very great weight to be underſtood, and to have room in our Chriſtian Faith as the top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone and glory thereof, and without which, we ſhall loſe the underſtanding of (and Faith in) the greateſt (if not the moſt glorious) part of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Goſpel truth.</p>
                  <p>In the diſcourſe I ſometimes mention what ſome others have ſaid about ſome of the things diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on, and eſpecially two Books, <hi>viz. The Practical Diſcourſe of the Sovereignty of God,</hi> and, <hi>The Death of Death by the Death of Chriſt:</hi> Not deſigning a particular anſwer to them, (nor had I at all mentioned them, had they not been ſent in by ſome deſignedly to lead us aſide from that which we believe to be the truth of the Goſpel) but have ſtated the truth about theſe matters, to the beſt of mine underſtanding from Scripture light, which if true, the ſubſtance of both are anſwered and muſt fall to the ground. And let none count it ſtrange, or tautologies, that I ſo often go over the ſame things in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, it is to ſhew the incongruity of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented principles and practices with Scripture light and right reaſon, in all the ways mentioned,
<pb facs="tcp:61328:10"/> it likewiſe being the method of God in Scripture, frequently to mention the ſame things over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again, deſignedly thereby to inculcate it on the memory and heart, that it might not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe, I think we have ground enough (at leaſt) to ſuppoſe, that the Apoſtaſie from the Primitive faith, <hi>as it was then delivered to the Saints,</hi> has been too much uſhered in by learned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>en, I ſuppoſe that it will eaſily appear, that in all the parts thereof, whether the Papabor others, ſome learned man (or men) lieth at the bottom thereof: And likewiſe has been chief actors in its propagation, and therefore it greatly concerns you now at laſt to be at work for God, Chriſt, the Goſpel and good of men in good earneſt, for diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thereof and reformation therein: O that you might have your ſhare in this matter! how might you honour God, and ſeaſon the Nation with the truth of the Goſpel both in faith and life, having the greateſt opportunities and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in order thereunto, in the ſincere endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of which you may expect Divine dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, aſſiſtance, and bleſſing; and O that this little Eſſay may tend to encourage herein, it being the common advantage and good of all, I really deſign; I hope I have not, I am ſure I would not <hi>follow cunning deviſed Fables</hi> for the world,
<pb facs="tcp:61328:10"/> and if I am in any thing miſtaken, I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be informed therein from Scripture light and right reaſon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 20. the things being of great, if not of greateſt concern, and (if I miſtake not) are all of them the revealed things of Divine wiſdom, and therefore it belongs to us to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring thereinto; and on theſe grounds, I am not willing to doubt your ready and inoffenſive reception of my poor endeavours in theſe great matters, with this my Dedication.</p>
                  <p>Conſidering firſt that you know, though all men are not skilled in the Langudges, nor in arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Philoſophy, yet it is radically in all rational men, without which they could not be capable ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of artificial attainments, or of Divine tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings.</p>
                  <p>2, That you know, God is at liberty in his teaching, (and always has been ſo) and therefore may (as formerly he has done) led the unlearned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to truth aſſon as the learned, and ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, <hi>Luke 10. 21. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 26. to 29. Therefore let not the Learned deſpiſe the unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor the unlearned judge the learned, but prize and own the teachings of God in each other, let us be humble and ſelf denying, let us own truth, and reject error where ere we find it, and thus it will be where Chriſt and Grace rules. O that none of us all may give the Lord cauſe to ſay of
<pb facs="tcp:61328:11"/> us as of his people of old, <hi>Hoſ. 8. 12. I have written to him the great things of my law, and they were counted as a ſtrange thing.</hi> I deſire that none of the great things God has written to us in his Goſpel law of grace, may be accounted ſtrange by us.</p>
                  <p>And thus (not to detain you any longer in this Dedication) I commit the enſuing Diſcourſe to your moſt ſerious conſiderations (and the like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all into whoſe hands it may come) if any thing therein carry not Scripture authority in it, let it not be credited, but if it do, take heed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware how you contradict it; this and no other is expected by him who longeth for the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel in its truth, purity, and power, the glory of God, and the good of all men.</p>

            <p>THis enſuing Treatiſe (or Chriſtian diſcourſe) as its brought forth by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial occaſion, ſo its really deſigned for thy ſpecial profiting and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual advantage, the name of God and Chriſt, the truth of the Goſpel, the ſpiritual and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal good of men being greatly concerned in the matters diſcourſed on, altho its true, that by reaſon of the Apoſtacy and other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, we may truly ſay <hi>that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (yea groſs darkneſs) hath covered us, and the vail and covering ſpread over all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hath very much bewildred us,</hi> and that in the great things of the glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God. And that which is moſt of all to
<pb facs="tcp:61328:12"/> be lamented is, that we are willing to have it ſo; if any glimmerings of light but begin to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear out of the darkneſs, we cry out upon it, as if ſome prodigious Comet, or foul ſpirit had appeared; and that (it may be) before we ſo much as admit of a ſerious ſearch, and due conſideration whether it be true or falſe: A won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful perverſe ſpirit ſeems to be in us on this account.</p>
            <p>Many (I am perſwaded) crying out on that they never ſaw, and others on that they never read with deliberation and judgment, ſeriouſly pondering it in the balance of the ſanctuary, and ſo <hi>ſpeak evil of the things they underſtand not,</hi> which neceſſarily may tend to bring under that wo. <hi>Iſa. 5, 20. Wo to them that call evil good, and good evil, that put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we are ſo averſe in our minds, as not to have patience to ponder ought but what our ſelves indulge, be it right or wrong, and cry down all that ſeems contrary thereunto, we may cry down truth for errour, and cry up errour inſtead of truth, its an old and known proverb, the burnt child dreads the fire, the ſence of which laid to heart, would tend to make us more wiſe.</p>
            <p>For help and cure in this matter, I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a few things to ſerious conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:61328:12"/>1. That its a matter of higheſt concern to us all, to underſtand; believe and obey the truth, to love the truth and peace, it being truth that muſt intreſt us in Goſpel freedom, and without the ſaving knowledge thereof we may not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to obtain it. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8, 31, 32.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we all come ſhort in our knowledge and underſtanding of the great things of the Goſpel, and may (and muſt) ſay; if we ſay right even in this very matter, that <hi>in many things we offend all,</hi> and need the mercy of God in our Lord Jeſus, to pardon and cover our ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norances, if not our wilfulneſs which on our repentance, he is ready to do.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That notwithſtanding this vail of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ignorance, &amp; too much of wilfulneſs, yet in the due and true ſence thereof, and (as its our great concern) if we be duely and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſearching and enquiring after the knowledg of the mind and will of God, as revealed in the word of his Grace, and that in all things relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to matters both of Faith and practice, its his promiſe that in this way, <hi>knowledge ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. And then ſhall they know, if they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low on to know the Lord.</hi> Dan. 12, 4. Hoſ. 6, 3.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And as an encouragement herein (and as its generally in word acknowledged) that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb facs="tcp:61328:13"/> of fundamental concern, are plainly (and not darkly) ſtated in the Scriptures, which is (or ſhould be) of encouragement to us all, to be enquiring thereinto, and to ſtrike dead that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and practice of putting harſh interpretations on the plain revealed will of God in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſo darkening, (if not outing and ending) even the fundamental truths thereof, the divine revelation being the alone ground and rule of our faith and practice, in all matters of Goſpel concern.</p>
            <p n="5">5.

Enoch <hi>the ſeventh from</hi> Adam <hi>propheſied,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Kain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> offered ſacrifice, probably by ſome Law from God, but <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 13, 14. puts it out of doubt, that they were not without Law. <hi>For until the Law, ſin was in the world, but ſin is not imputed where there is no Law,</hi> therefore there was ſome Law; that being the deſign of the Apoſtle, to prove that they had ſome Law, or there had been no ſin.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. When God called <hi>Abraham</hi> out from all the world, as an act of Sovereign love, will and power and owned

                  <p>6. That Doctrine that teacheth men not to glorifie God, nor blame themſelves in the Judgment, but rather Eternally to curſe God, muſt needs be very irreligious; but to teach people that God from his Sovereign will made them on purpoſe to damn them Eternally, without hope or help, muſt needs teach them not to blame themſelves, but curſe God, and not glorifie him in the Judgment, if they ſhould then believe as now they are taught, but they ſhall then know the contrary; and if they curſe any, it ſhall be themſelves, and ſuch Teachers as Deceived them with Falſe Doctrine, and ſhall glorifie God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 64. 8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12.</p>

That it doth abuſe God in his Sovereignty and truth, is moſt apparent, not only from all that has been ſaid, but in that he not only ſaith, but ſweareth, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 32. &amp; 33. 11. <hi>That he hath no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that he ſhould turn from his way and live,</hi> and 1 Tim. 2. 4. <hi>That he will have all to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, and that he loved the world in the gift of his Son, and ſent him into the world not to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved.</hi> Joh. 3. 16, 17. <hi>And that he gave his fleſh for the life of the world,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. I thought we ſhould find thoſe glorious principles of truth before mention'd by the ſame Author, ſubjected and contradicted, <hi>viz. That righteouſneſs is the rule of his will, and that he will not command men to do right, and not do ſo himſelf, and that he will puniſh none without a cauſe, nor more than is deſerved,</hi> and yet now, has Eternally diſpoſed of men from his own will, made them to be Veſſels of wrath, in a word, to ſin and be damned, that's the true ſenſe, horrible abuſe to God, and contradiction of himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He might well call it an aſtoniſhing glory, were it true, enough to aſtoniſh and affright all men (were it laid to heart) out of all their Reaſon and Religion too; but it being not ſo, but a device of men, it's ſo far from being an aſtoniſhing Glory, that it's an aſtoniſhing Falſhood, and to be rejected of all ſober men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I ſtill thought, that God had made all for himſelf, for his own glory, and not that he had made the world for the ſake of ſome, and when and where he will prove that God made any for the ſake of ſome, I do not yet know, I ſuppoſe you muſt take his word for it, as for all the reſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And as to the whole of this matter, I have often ſaid enough to it elſewhere, <hi>viz.</hi> that we may not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand one Scripture, ſo as is contrary to the whole Word of God that ſpeaks of the ſame matter, where
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61328:25"/> he ſaith that he loved the world in the gift of his Son, and calleth upon all, and inviteth all to accept the grace, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17. <hi>That he hath no pleaſure in the Death of the wicked. That men by ſin deſtroy themſelves,</hi> Hoſ. 13. 9. <hi>That he would have all men to be ſaved.</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 4. it muſt needs be irreligious to underſtand <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. ſo as to contradict, and give the lie to all thoſe Scriptures and many more, this is enough, were there no more to be ſaid in this matter.</p>
                  <p>Yet, further I ſay, that thoſe Scriptures, <hi>viz. Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> contributes nothing at all to that Scriptureleſs Notion, rightly underſtood, but rather ſtrongly confirms the truth of what is by me aſſerted; and this appeareth. <hi>1ſt.</hi> In that there is nothing ſaid about the Eternal Decrees and Sovereign Will, diſtinct from his Sovereign rule by his own declared Laws, the Apoſtle in the whole Treating about the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> already made, and under his preſent Sovereign Government, who did wilfully ſin away their mercy in rejecting the Goſpel, and as a puniſhment of this their ſin, God did (or might) give them up to blindneſs and hardneſs of heart, not that he made them for that end by Eternal Decree, but in the preſent exerciſe of his Sovereign power and Providence, as a puniſhment of their former ſins, ſo he might make of the ſame lump of the <hi>Jews</hi> one Veſſel to honour and another to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and this he has uſually done in like caſe, and it's that which will ſtand with his Sovereign rule in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> to give men up to hardneſs of heart as a puniſhment of diſobedience, rejection or abuſe of former mercy, thus he did to the ſame people former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81. 11. 12.

                     <hi>up to their own hearts luſts, and they walked in their own Councils.</hi> So likewiſe he dealt with the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Rom. 1. 21. <hi>Becauſe when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were they thankful,</hi> v. 24. 28. <hi>Wherefore God gave them up unto uncleanneſs, through the luſts of their own hearts;</hi> ſo likewiſe in the Apoſtacy fore-told, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10, 11. <hi>Becauſe they received not the love of the truth that they might be ſaved, and for this Cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe a lie.</hi> Thus God ordinarily puniſheth one ſin by giving up to another, which was the preſent Caſe in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. they ſinned away their mercy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Goſpel, and the hardneſs of heart they were given up to, was as a puniſhment of ſin; ſo that it doth not at all relate to the Eternal Decree, that God made them, or any other people to be deſtroyed, but as a puniſhment of ſin, he in Juſtice gave them up to hardneſs of heart. And in this ſenſe it is the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>wrath was come upon them to the uttermoſt.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 16. and this the practical Diſcourſe of Sovereignty in ſome Caſes acknowledgeth, <hi>pag.</hi> 12. <hi>viz.</hi> Ezek. 14. 9. <hi>And if the Prophet be deceived, I the Lord have deceived that prophet and will deſtroy him.</hi> and 1 King. 22. <hi>touching the lying Spirit, and the effectual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion he had from God to perſuade and alſo to prevail,</hi> yet confeſſeth, <hi>that he does not reckon theſe two, as pure acts of Sovereignty, but rather as puniſhing one ſin by leaving to another, and to this mentions, Rom.</hi> 1. 21, 28. by which it appears, that nothing is by them, accounted pure Acts of Sovereignty, but an abſolute diſpoſe of perſons by Eternal Decree, without relation to ſin as the Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>But this being granted, that God doth ſometimes puniſh one ſin by leaving to another, tends to lead him
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61328:26"/> into a right underſtanding of <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. &amp; 11 <hi>Chapters,</hi> it being ſo apparently manifeſt, that it was as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their former ſins, and not from any Decree of Reprobation before the world was, no otherwiſe than for ſin as the cauſe thereof, and no otherwiſe may we underſtand or imagin any Decreed Will in God, of wrong to them or any others; for this read and ponder <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 34. &amp; 19. 41, 42. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 1. to 8. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 46. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 15, 16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17. in all which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures it appears, that God and Chriſt was really for their good, and for the good and welfare of all men, and that damnation comes in by unbelief and diſobedience.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall; in which it will appear, there is not a ſentence in either of thoſe Chapters, relating to Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation by Eternal Decree before the world was, but the preſent diſpoſe of perſons in way of righteouſneſs, ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their demeanours towards God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. to 13. is the diſtinction that God made between <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael, Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> the one being Children of the Fleſh, the others of Promiſe and purpoſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It's apparent, it relates to the two Covenants made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> one relating to his natural ſeed; in which was the Promiſe of the Land of <hi>Canaan. Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8. <hi>the other with the Spiritual ſeed in Chriſt, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all nations.</hi> Gen. 22. 18. <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth be bleſſed.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61328:26"/> clearly diſtinguiſheth between the two Covenants and the two Seeds, <hi>v.</hi> 8. to 12. the time being come that the new Covenant taketh place as a Miniſtration, the old Covenant and Seed muſt give place unto it, and the Children of Promiſe (that is of Faith) are counted for the ſeed; and in this ſenſe, <hi>all are not</hi> Iſrael <hi>that are of</hi> Iſrael, becauſe the Goſpel now, <hi>knows no man after the fleſh.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16. This new and ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant taking place according to purpoſe and Promiſe, now owns only the Spiritual ſeed of Faith, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and this the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtumbled at, not believing the Goſpel, by reaſon of which they were rejected, this being the proper ſcope of the Apoſtle in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. &amp; 11. <hi>Chapters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. More particularly and diſtinctly, the Election and rejection of theſe Perſons, perſonally was, one was Elected to National and Covenant priviledges, and the rejection of the others was from thoſe Priviledges, and not to Eternal Condemnation, it having no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereunto, nor from other great and Temporal bleſſings, in which God abounded to them. <hi>Gen.</hi> 21 13. 18. &amp; 36. 15. And this Election of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and leaving of <hi>Eſau,</hi> being National; and to ſpecial Priviledges, to one above the other, was alone from the free-will and pleaſure of God without any relation to works done, <hi>it being before they were born, or had done good or evil;</hi> which was a juſt and Sovereign liberty in God, doing no wrong thereby to them that were left out of this Election, as Gods calling <hi>Abraham</hi> out from the world, did no wrong to the world; nor was their rejection, but only from that Call and Choice, ſo was his carrying it on to <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> (leaving <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau)</hi> according to his juſt and Sovereign rule over men, the promiſe being to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed. <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 15, 16.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61328:27"/> God was at liberty to fix it on whom he pleaſed, while it was upon his Seed to whom the Promiſe was made, and ſo did no wrong to either <hi>Iſhmael</hi> or <hi>Eſau,</hi> eſpecially he making large proviſion for them both; and as to what is ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 13. Jacob <hi>have I loved and</hi> Eſau <hi>have I hated.</hi> It's taken out of <hi>Mal,</hi> 1. 2, 3. ſpoken long after <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were perſonally dead, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were born, as by ſome is vainly and fooliſhly ſuggeſted, and relates to their Poſterities, ſo called when they were dead and gone: and in this ſenſe, God hated <hi>Eſau</hi> for their ſins, <hi>and laid his mountains waſte,</hi> but is never ſaid to hate him before he was born, but only this, <hi>the Elder ſhall ſerve the Younger.</hi> So that the deſign of the Apoſtle in the whole matter is, to ſhew the Juſt liberty of God in rejecting the <hi>Jews</hi> for their ſinning againſt him in his Goſpel law of Grace, as all the after inſtances do likewiſe fully demonſtrate, as <hi>v.</hi> 15. relates to the ſame people, when they had formerly ſinned away their mercy, in making a Calf in the Wilderneſs. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 19. <hi>I will ſhew mercy to whom I will ſhew mercy.</hi> Which relates not to their Eternal Eſtate, but to the preſent exerciſe of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Rule over them, they having forfeited their mercy by ſin, <hi>and God had ſaid to</hi> Moſes <hi>that he would deſtroy them all.</hi> chap. 32. 9. to 14. and upon <hi>Moſes</hi> Prayer and Interceſſion for them, <hi>The Lord repented of the evil that he thought to do unto them.</hi> Yet in this grace, he reſerves this Sovereign liberty, <hi>to ſhew mercy on whom he would,</hi> viz. he would carry whom of them he pleaſed into the Promiſed Land, and whom he pleaſed ſhould for their ſin die in the Wilderneſs, not be Eternally damned. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> for ſin died in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and might not go into the good Land, and who dare ſay they were Eternally damned? So likewiſe,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61328:27"/> when Chriſt and the Goſpel was come, and they reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſhare therein. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 46. God would now exerciſe the ſame Sovereign Power over them, <hi>viz, To ſhew mercy to whom of them he would ſhew mercy,</hi> even of thoſe who had alike ſinned, and whom he would he would give up to their own hardneſs of heart, in which his Sovereign Power and Will was (and ſtill is) exerciſed towards Men in like capacity. And as for Verſ. 21. Of the Potters <hi>Power over the Clay, of the ſame lump, to make one Veſſel to honour and another to diſhonour:</hi> It's likewiſe taken from the Lords former dealing with the ſame People when they had Rebelled againſt Him. <hi>Jer</hi> 18. 2. to 6. <hi>the Veſſel the Potter made was marred in his hand, ſo he made it again, another Veſſel as ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good unto the Potter.</hi> v. 6. <hi>O houſe of Iſrael, cannot I do with you as the Potter, ſaith the Lord?</hi> And it ſtill holds true that this, or any other People, that hath, or ſhall Rebel againſt the Lord, and his good will towards them, it ſuits with his Sovereign Government, <hi>to have mercy on whom he will have mercy,</hi> he may have mercy on ſome ſuch, and others he may give up to hardneſs of heart; he may do as the Potter, <hi>viz.</hi> break them if he pleaſe, and make another Veſſel of them as he pleaſed, as he did with them of old, to which the Apoſtle refors: and in ſo doing, none have cauſe <hi>to find fault, or to ſay unto him, who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> (if they do) they find fault with the Juſt and Sovereign rule of God over men, it being in this way he makes known his Sovereign Power and Rules <hi>by enduring with much long ſuffering, the Veſſels of Wrath fitted to deſtruction.</hi> v. 22. and to this agreeth and cleareth the whole matter to us. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 17. <hi>and</hi> 64. 8, 9. and on this account it is they could not believe. <hi>Joh,</hi> 12. 29.</p>

                  <p>I have yet five things further to ſay, 1. It appears that the Apoſtle did not intend in his whole diſcourſe, their Reprobation by eternal decree, (any otherwiſe than as has been minded) becauſe <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. He declares his <hi>great heavineſs and ſorrow of heart for them, and could wiſh himſelf accurſed from Chriſt for their ſakes.</hi> And certainly he would not have been ſo heavily grieved and ſorrowful, at the Eternal Decree of God, which ſo, it muſt flow from his diſlike thereof; but it was for their obſtinacy and unbelief, as Chriſt himſelf was. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 41, 42.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Speaking of theſe very ſame People that rejected, and for whom he was ſo grieved, ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>that the Adoption, and the Covenants and the Promiſes, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto them,</hi> i. e. in right, it did all belong unto them, if they did not forfeit their right by unbelief: Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, Covenants and Promiſes, including not only the old (then ended) but the new, according to <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 25. <hi>Ye are the Children of the Prophets, and of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which God made with your Fathers, ſaying unto Abraham, and in thy ſeed, ſhall all the kindreds of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi> This is the new Covenant in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, of which they were the Children, the firſt right belonged to them by promiſe, as they were the natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> if they did not forfeit and loſe their right by unbelief. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 46. <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. And therefore could not be Reprobated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from by eternal decree, and yet be the Children thereof, till they loſt their right by unbelief and diſobedience to the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If their ſin and rejection had been the fruit of the Eternal Decree, then it muſt have been well pleaſing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61328:28"/> unto God, for I think it's little leſs than Blaſphemy againſt God, to ſay he is not well pleaſed with the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of his Decreed will, and then there could not have been <hi>ſo much long ſuffering in God,</hi> while they were doing his Decreed will, as it is ſaid there was. <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>What if God endured with much long ſuffering the Veſſels of Wrath,</hi> &amp;c. But the much long ſuffering in God was, while they were doing that which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Will. Men are not ſaid to ſuffer long, while thoſe they wait upon are doing their will and work, unleſs they are too long about it, or do it not to their minds.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 1. <hi>Brethren, my hearts deſire and Prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they might be ſaved.</hi> And v. 2. <hi>For I bear them Record, they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledg.</hi> And we cannot Religiouſly imagin, that the Apoſtle would pray againſt the Eternal Decree of God, no, no; he then could not Pray in Faith on any account, and it would have argued that he liked not the decree, but was willing to have it altered, which we may not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, but that he was grieved for the obſtinacy of his Brethren, and Prayed the Lord to turn their hearts, having ſome hopes that they were not arrived to the higheſt Degree of wilfulneſs, but that their diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, did ariſe much from Ignorant and Blind zeal, <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. On which account he had ſome hope that on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance they might obtain mercy, tho he had ſo ſpoken of them before, in <hi>ch.</hi> 9. elſe he would not have Prayed for them. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 16.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Foundation cauſe of their rejection, (ſo far as it was) is by the Apoſtle reſulted and concluded, <hi>ch.</hi> 9. 32. and 10. 3. to be, <hi>becauſe they ſought it not by Faith, but as it were by the works of the Law, for</hi>

Had they fixed ſuch things on the Devil, as they do on the Holy God, they might have been credited, (had he power ſo to do) but to render God to be worſe to Men than it's poſſible for the Devil to be, is to be abhor'd of all that love and fear him, therefore take heed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware thereof.

                  <p>3. Nor doth this perſonal Election, in the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the general Grace of God to Men, nor does it in the leaſt import or imply, that all the reſt (or any) are Decreed from the Sovereign and Eternal will of God to be damned, (otherwiſe than as for tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing his Laws, perſevering therein to the end;) that I take to be a great miſtake, and wrong both to God and Men, but that the general love of God to the world, as Proclaimed in the Goſpel, ſtands free and clear, notwithſtanding this Election, and that all, that truly beleive and obey the Goſpel, perſevering therein to the end, are the Elect and choſen of God and ſhall be ſaved, and that the finally unbelievers and diſobedient, are therefore reprobated and muſt be damned.</p>

                  <p>1. The Election of Perſons to particular of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and works, as <hi>Jeremiah;</hi> the Lord ſaid to him, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee; and before thou cameſt out of the womb, I ſanctified thee, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained thee to be a Prophet to the nations,</hi> Jer. 1. 5. this preordaining and ſetting a part of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> before he was born, to be a Prophet to the nations, did not in the leaſt imply that there ſhould be no other Prophets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Jeremiah;</hi> neither did it at all derogate, from the Propheſies of other Prophets of the Lord, of whom we read nothing of ſuch a Preordaining, neither may we affirm they were ſo ordained, the Scripture being ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent herein.</p>
                  <p>So the like of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who was Ordained by name, to a great and noble work, long before he was born. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 28. and 45. 1, yet this Decree, no whit hindered
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61328:34"/> others that had a heart, to ſet a hand to the ſame work, of whom we read of no ſuch preordination there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as not only <hi>Cyrus. Ezra.</hi> 1. but <hi>Darius</hi> ch. 6. and <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> ch. 7. So that particular Decrees, is no hinderance to others in that which is good. So the like of <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaith. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 15. that he was <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to his Apoſtleſhip from his Mothers womb.</hi> Yet others of whom the Scripture gives no ſuch Teſtimony, were not at all prohibited from Preaching the ſame Goſpel. I might inſtance among the Lords choſen People of old, there were ſeveral Elections, yet without wrong (but rather to the advantage) of the reſt. As <hi>David,</hi> was his choſen King, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 78. 68. and his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity till the Kingdom came to Chriſt the Son of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſ.</hi> 89. 29, to 36. And the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for Prieſts and Miniſters in the ſervice of God, to come neareſt to him, yet in all, it was without any wrong, (but for advantage) to the reſt.

                  <p>The firſt Election and choice we read of in Scripture is that of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, who were choſen out from all the world beſides, to be a peculiar People to the Lord, yet this Election, did not repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate all the world beſides to Eternal death; yet I am ſure there is more ſaid of the ſpecialneſs and peculiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this Election (as diſtinct from all the world,) than is of, his Perſonal Election under the Goſpel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 19. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 5, 6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 6, 7, 8. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this ſpecial and perſonal choice, alone from free Grace and Love, was without any wrong at all to (or reprobation of the) reſt of the world only left out of that choice.</p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:61328:35"/>
                  <p>For, 1. The world was left in no worſe condition, than before this Election of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed.</p>
                  <p>2. A liberty was left for any others to become pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felites, and ſo partake in the ſame covenant and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and many of them did ſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 10. &amp; 13. 43. &amp; 10. 27. A lively pattern of Goſpel Election, take it in what ſence you will, it hinders none, but rather furthers the Salvation of others.</p>
                  <p>3. Notwithſtanding this Election, God ſtill retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his real property in the world as his own, as much as before <hi>Abraham</hi> was choſen out from them, and that, not to deſtroy and damn them, but to do them good, <hi>Ex.</hi> 9. 5. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 145. 9, 15, 16. If God in this Election, had reprobated all the world to the ſecond death, wo bad been to us ſinners, of the Gentiles, there could then have been no ſuch thing as Goſpel, Grace or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to us, and this Controverſie had been over and ended.</p>
                  <p>4. And it's apparent, that God had many precious People in the world out of that Election, as <hi>Job, of whom was not the like on the earth,</hi> Job 23. <hi>Who was of the land of</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> who was not within this Election And <hi>Rahab</hi> the harlot Canonized for a Saint, for hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpies, with others that might be mentioned.</p>
                  <p>5. And <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, that was firſt and chief in this Election, was ſo far from monopolizing all to himſelf and to his natural ſeed, that it's apparent, he expected many Righteous Perſons to be in the world beſides himſelf, as appears in his Prayer for <hi>Sodom,</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:61328:35"/> 
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. He began at fifty Righteous, ſuppoſing that to be but a few, tho in his love to <hi>Lot,</hi> he deſcended by degrees to ten, accounting that ſo few, that he durſt not mention a leſſer number.</p>
                  <p>6 And more than this, he believed for the world; <hi>in thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations of the earth be bleſſed, Gen.</hi> 1. 2, 3. &amp; 15. 5, 6. &amp; 18. 18. &amp; 22. 18. If he had not believed this promiſe of a Son and ſeed, in whom all the Nations ſhould be bleſſed, I know no ground to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that he could have arrived to the Dignity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Heir of the world, or Father of the Faithful, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. And how they will prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be his Children, or Heirs of the world with him, (as all true believers are <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16.) who are ſo far from his Faith, as that they believe the damnation of the world by Eternal Decree, it behoves them to conſider in time.</p>
                  <p>2. To proſecute this Election, when it muſt paſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> is left out, it was without any wrong to him, God making large proviſion for him elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 13, 18. Beſides, thoſe two with their Mothers, were an Allegory of the two Covenants with their ſeeds, <hi>Gal</hi> 4. 22, 25. And <hi>Iſhmael</hi>'s rejection was not to the ſecond death, but from being Heir with <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 21. 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 30.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe <hi>Eſau,</hi> when <hi>Jacob</hi> was fixed on and <hi>Eſau</hi> left, it was not with any wrong to him, the promiſe hitherto reſiding in the free will and pleaſure of God, and not by ſucceſſive inheritance upon the elder; while it was conferr'd on <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſeed, the promiſe was exactly performed, and that without any wrong at all to <hi>Eſau,</hi> eſpecially, God making large proviſion for him elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>Gen.</hi> 36. 6, 7. His rejection from the Covenant and Promiſe being not to the ſecond death, which I
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61328:36"/> ſuppoſe none dare to affirm it was. Tho on <hi>Jacob</hi> and all his poſterity, God ſetled the promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 2, 3, 4. So that this Election, was ſo far from reprobating the world, or any part thereof to the ſecond death, or to any other wrong, that it was of very great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the world.</p>
                  <p>And that 1. Thereby a liberty and advantage was given to the Gentiles, to come to know and worſhip God, in becoming proſelites.</p>
                  <p>2. He made large proviſion for the world, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Temporal bleſſings, and by the common means and light afforded to the world, had many precious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple therein.</p>
                  <p>And 3. One muſt come of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, that ſhould be the Saviour of the world, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>In whom all the nations of the earth ſhall be bleſſed, Gen.</hi> 22. 18. So that the world loſed nothing, but gained by that Election.</p>
                  <p>And for any to imagin an Election in the Goſpel, by Eternal Decree, ſo as to reprobate all the world beſides to Eternal Damnation, is both unſcriptural and irrational, tending to undo the Goſpel, and to render the deſign of God therein, to be more for Damnation, than for Salvation, and to render this his Election therein, to be contrary to any ſort of his Elections from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, all his actings towards men (in ſuch caſes) having been in it ſelf, for good to men and not for hurt; what of hurt comes to men being of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>4. Election in the New Teſtament (taken in the ſtricteſt ſenſe) is no where ſo ſtated, as to give us any ground of ſuppoſition, that a'l the reſt muſt be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but it keeps the Door wide open for all commers, that come rightly, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16, 17. &amp; 6. 40.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61328:36"/> 
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17. Whence it is that this wide Door, ſhould be ſo ſtrangely ſhut up and bar'd againſt the world, we may eaſily underſtand, that it's not from God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 20. But from the Prince and power of darkneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>5. Tho I own particular and perſonal Election (as before I ſaid) yet I do not believe it as ſome; <hi>Sovereign Diſcourſe,</hi> p. 55. <hi>That the Doctrine of Election con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the whole ſum and ſcope of the Goſpel.</hi> And p. 69. <hi>That Election is the great Fundamental inſtitute of the Goſpel, the Supreme Law.</hi> I ſay, as held by him, <hi>viz.</hi> With the abſolute reprobation of all the world beſides; it's no Goſpel at all, nor any part thereof, if we believe the Scripture, and call that Goſpel which the Scripture ſo calls, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Behold I bring you glad tidings of great joy which ſhall be to all People,</hi> Mar. 16. 15. <hi>Preach the Goſpel to every Creature,</hi> &amp;c. This is Goſpel; but I am ſure, that Election (as pleaded for) is no where called Goſpel, nor mentioned at all in the Scriptures, no: if it were (which is far from it) it would be the ſadeſt tidings that ever came to the world, worſe than the ſin and fall of the firſt Man, which brought the world under the firſt death only, if the ſecond came only to raiſe the world to Eternal Damnation, the ſecond death, which is far worſe than the firſt, O wo would be to the world that ever Chriſt came, which is indeed the beſt tidings that ever came to the world. And if men loſe the advantage thereof, it's their own fault, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 19. Nor do I know where it is, that Election is called a Goſpel Law, either in terms, or in the true ſenſe thereof, much leſs the Supreme Law, eſpecially as held, if ſo, it would be a Law of Damnation, far more than of Salvation; but the Supreme Law of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61328:37"/> the Goſpel is, that <hi>whoſo believeth and obeyeth the Goſpel ſhall be ſaved; and he that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> Mar. 16. 16. this is the Supreme Law of the Goſpel, by which we muſt all at laſt ſtand or fall. And againſt which there is (nor can be) no Decree, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 48. I have often thought, that thoſe who are ſo mercileſs, as to damn the world by Eternal Decree, think themſelves ſure by their Law of Election; but I do earneſtly adviſe them, to ſee they ſtand clear in the true Faith and Life of the Goſpel, without which there is (nor can be) no ſafety.</p>
                  <p>6. And ſo from the whole, I conclude, that God never Elected any with deſign of wrong to the reſt, but rather of advantage, if rightly improved.</p>

That notwithſtanding he has by Decree, laid a neceſſity of Periſhing upon ſuch, yet the Goſpel muſt be Preached to them, deſignedly to damn them the deeper, for that which they could not help, nor was any Grace thereby intended to them; a greater wrong cannot be done to men, nor a greater wrong to God, and the Goſpel of his Grace to men.</p>

                  <p>1. This Scripture in the proper intention thereof, intends the breaking down of the middle wall of partition between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> that now there is no difference on the Goſpel account.</p>
                  <p>And 2. It ſtands true (and ever did) <hi>that in every Nation he that feareth God and worketh Righteouſneſs is accepted;</hi> ſo was <hi>Cornelius</hi> before he knew the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
                  <p>3. Particular Election may ſtand without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction at all to that Scripture, or any other of like import, whilſt God doth notwithſtanding, accept of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that doth fear him and work Righteouſneſs; for we may underſtand, and muſt allow this Sovereign li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in God, which men rationally and rightfully claim to themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> a freedom of love and choice, whilſt none are wronged thereby, God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto, and loved <hi>Abraham</hi> and his feed, above all the world beſides, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 6, 7.

And Chriſt loved one Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple above the reſt, yet without any wrong, or offence, to any of the reſt, men do (and Lawfully may) fix love on particular objects, and while it's without wrong or hatred to others, it's no unlawful reſpecting of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>

                  <p>I know that this is the great plea, to end the plain Truth of the Scripture, and I could name ſeveral of the Perſons concerned herein, and I do eaſily grant that the word world doth not always intend all the world, but often a part thereof, yet when ſo, a great part thereof is intended; but that the word world in this place doth not intend, the Elect, or Church, or Believers only, is as apparent as the Sun when it ſhines at Noon, and I yet never met with either Scripture or Reaſon ſufficient to contradict it, tho (I think) I have read as learned and able, as any that has attempted it, and that it does not (nor cannot) intend the world of Elect only, I ſhall ſtate ſome weighty grounds to the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Elect are no where called the world in Scripture; that's not yet proved, nor is never like to be: but becauſe the wicked are called the world, when they are but a part thereof, therefore the Elect may be ſo called, and ſuch like arguments, to argue out the plain Truth of Scripture; but till it can be proved that the Elect are called the world, it muſt remain as a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptureleſs notion; that's the firſt.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. It's ſuch a world, as that <hi>whoſoever of them do believe, ſhall have Eternal life,</hi> in which note, 1. That it's the world of unbelievers that he loved, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of them do believe, might have life. After they believe they are not of the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 19. 2. It's ſuch a world, as of which it's clearly implyed, that ſome of them may periſh through unbelief, whoſoever doth believe ſhall not periſh, clearly implying, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of them doth not believe ſhall periſh, fully agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the commiſſion, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 15, 16. <hi>Go into all the world, Preach the Goſpel to every Creature, he that believeth and is Baptized ſhall be ſaved, he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> So here he (or whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth believe) ſhall not periſh, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſhall not be damned; ſo that it's apparent, it's the ſame world that God loved, to whom the Goſpel is by Commiſſion to be Preached, and that is to all. And ſuch a world as of which many (if not moſt) may periſh through unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, which the Elect world (in the owners own ſenſe cannot) do, which clearly contradicteth their notion in this matter.</p>
                  <p n="4">4, It appeareth from <hi>v.</hi> 17. 19. <hi>God ſent not his Son into the world, to condemn the world, but that the world by him might be ſaved.</hi> It's the ſame world, he ſtill ſpeaks of, that he was not ſent to condemn but to ſave, and that it's evident, that ſome of this world that God loved, and Chriſt was ſent to ſave (as before I ſaid)
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61328:39"/> may be condemned, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>This is the Condemnation that light is come into the world, and men love dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds are evil.</hi> God loved the world, and gave his Son to ſave the world, the world loves darkneſs rather than this light of Love and Salvation, and this is (and will be) the Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not want of love in God, nor want of a Saviour, but becauſe they loved the darkneſs of ignorance and ſin, more than this light of Love, Life and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſurely this is not the Elect world, who love Darkneſs more than Light and be Condemned.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Not only becauſe the expreſs terms and ſcope of that Scripture clears it, not to intend the Elect only, but the whole Scope of the whole Scriptures clears it likewiſe, the deſign of Love to the world in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being included in that promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.

                  <p>For anſwer to this, I ſhall refer you to the <hi>3d.</hi> particular to be ſpoken to in this Chapter, namely, the varieties of the ends of the death of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And as for the word all, tho it doth not always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend all, in many other caſes, yet in this it does, proved not only from the reaſon before given, <hi>viz.</hi> the deſign in the Goſpel of good will to all, which is the Fundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the general expreſſions in the Scriptures about the Redemption work by Chriſt, as world and all; but 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. giveth us further and full light, in all ſuch like expreſſions about the ſame matter. <hi>Who gave himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the great queſtion is, whether all in this Scripture intends the Elect only, or all the world, I ſuppoſe it will be granted by all, that it intends one or both of them; I ſay both, but that it intends not the Elect on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, apparently appears. Which I ſhall endevour to clear as followeth:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. Is an Exhortation, that <hi>firſt of all, Prayers Interceſſion and giving of Thanks be made for all Men.</hi> Verſ. 2. <hi>For Kings and for all that are in Authority.</hi> This being the Foundation of all that follows to <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. as arguments to inforce the Exhortation of Praying for
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61328:41"/> all, and if the firſt all for whom we are to Pray, be not the Elect only, then the other that follows is not. The firſt argument ſeems to ariſe as the reaſon of the Exhortation of Praying for all, in the word therefore. <hi>I Exhort therefore,</hi> verſ. 1. which relates to ſomething ſpoken before, as a reaſon of the Exhortation, and moſt probably to <hi>ch.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>This is a Faithful ſaying, and Worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world, to ſave ſinners.</hi> i. e. Sinners in general, without exception, or limitation (if they believe and obey the Goſpel,) <hi>I Exhort therefore, that Prayers be made for all Men.</hi> In that which follows:</p>
                  <p>The 1. Argument to enforce the Exhortation is, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>This is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour.</hi> A great encouragement it is to Pray for all, <hi>it being good and acceptable in the ſight of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 2 is <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Who will have all men to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the Truth.</hi> It's the ſame all, that we are to pray for, and a great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is to Pray for them, if God willeth to have them ſaved.</p>
                  <p>And the 3. Argument is <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. From the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory office of Chriſt, <hi>for there is one God, and one Mediator between God and Men, the Man Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;</hi> a great encouragement it is, to Pray for all men, Jeſus Chriſt being upon his Mediatory Office and Work for men in general.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>4th</hi> Argument is, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>He gave himſelf a ranſom for all,</hi> and therefore, it's no marvel he Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates for all, and commands us to Pray for all, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame all that we are to Pray for, that he dyed for, and for whom he Mediates, and that he will have to be ſaved; now let us conſider, whether this be all the Elect only. Two things declare the contrary. Firſt,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61328:41"/> 
                     <hi>It's for all Men, for Kings, and for all in authority.</hi> And ſurely all Men, and all in Authority, are not the Elect only, eſpecially in thoſe days, when the moſt of men were Heathen Idolaters, and almoſt all that were in Authority the ſame, and yet this is the all, that God will have us Pray for, that he willeth to be ſaved, and for whom Chriſt died, and for whom he mediates. And if this all be the Elect only, then there are more Elect than they will grant, or (I think) any elſe, and by this way the other Scriptures that aſſures us of Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for all, be underſtood. And further, the Scripture lets us to know, that <hi>ſome denied the Lord that bought them,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 1. I know men exerciſe their wits, to get off from the weight of this Scripture, which as a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of Lead, ſinks them in this matter, <hi>as Death of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Another ſhift is, <hi>There is no mention of Blood in the Text, and therefore a doubt whether it was with the purchaſe of the Blood of Chriſt that they were bought.</hi>

                  <p>And further he ſaith, <hi>there is no purchaſe, but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, from the blindneſs of Judaiſm, in eſcaping the pollutions of the world.</hi> It's true, that was the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the purchaſe, the ſame as to hem that were not fallen, but were in the precious Faith of the Goſpel. <hi>ch.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Having eſcaped the corruptions that are in the world through luſt,</hi> the ſame that is ſpoken of, of them that were fallen, <hi>ch.</hi> 2. 18.

                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe no Argument, or Inference drawn from any Scripture, can poſſibly be true, nor may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, that is contrary to the expreſs Letter and Scope of Scripture as this is, as before has been plainly proved.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61328:43"/> 
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. Unleſs they will deny that he dyed for them, or affirm that he Prayed for them after they were dead, which I think, they will ſcarce do either.</p>
                  <p>But 2. Tho Chriſt in his Prayer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Prayed for his Diſciples, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. And for all actual believers, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. And if he interceeds for none elſe, then he Prayed not, nor interceeds for the Converſion of any, no, not for their Elect world, and then (on their own account) he prayed not for them, for they ſay, he prayed not for the world; and yet they ſay the Elect are the world, ſo that on their account, he prayed not, nor interceeds for the Converſion of any, but only for his Diſciples and actual believers. By which you may ſee how ill their arguments will hold together.</p>
                  <p>3. Chriſt did pray for the world; and this is moſt apparent, if we conſider his Prayer, which hath in this matter three Gradations. 1. He Prayeth diſtinctly for his preſent Diſciples, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. And in this petition, he prayed not for the world, nor for all Believers. 2. In <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. He prayed for all Believers. 3. And in this Petition, he did as well pray for the world, as for Believers: that being the reaſon (yea and all the reaſon rendered) why he prayed for Believers, it was for the worlds falſe, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. That Believers might ſo walk, in Unity, that the world ſeeing thereof <hi>might believe that he was ſent of God.</hi> By which it's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that the very end of his praying for Believers was for the worlds ſake, in which he as really pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the world, as for Believers, and wonderful ignorance it is, in thoſe who affirm, that he did not pray for the world.</p>

                  <p>This is boldly affirmed, but the plain truth of the matter is, that the great end of Chriſt in praying for Unity among Believers was, that the world might believe that he was the ſent of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> That they might believe and be ſaved.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61328:44"/> but that the end of his coming was to be the Saviour of the world, they knew, the <hi>Jews</hi> by the propheſies and promiſes thereof, <hi>that he ſhould be for Salvation to the ends of the Earth,</hi> Iſa. 49. 6. &amp; 45. 22. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 11.

                     <hi>It is objected; If Chriſt dyed for the World, why is not the Goſpel Preached to all the World, there being many parts of the world where it is not known, and it is not likely he ſhould dye for them, and not Vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to make it known to them.</hi>

                  <p>As to this, it's enough (were there no more to be ſaid in this matter) that the Lord both ſent the Goſpel by Commiſſion, to be Preached <hi>to all the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Mar. 16. 15. <hi>Among all Nations,</hi> Luk. 24. 47. So that there is no bar (or limit) ſet by the Lord upon it; the defect lyeth in Men, and not in the Lord, or the Commiſſion for publiſhing thereof, it having been the uſual method of God in his Diſpenſations towards Men, to give the word, and leave the Iſſue to men for the improvement thereof; ſo he did to <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo to the world, in the Law of Creation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20, 21. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 26, 27. And ſo to <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, and ſo in the Goſpel. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 15, 16. <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſtrangers to the Law, and ſometimes loſt it, and after, found it again, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 8. And tho the world was more large (unto whom the Goſpel was ſent) than the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whom the Law was ſent, yet God had ſo ordered it (over and above the general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61328:45"/> for publiſhing thereof) that at the firſt pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of the Spirit in order thereunto, there were preſent, <hi>ſome out of every Nation under Heaven,</hi> Act. 2. 5. Which doubtleſs tended much to the publiſhing of the Goſpel among the Nations, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 23. And if the Nations have loſt it, or be Apoſtatized from the truth thereof, the fault is in themſelves, and not in God, nor does it at all argue, that Chriſt died not for them, nor that if they periſh, it is for want of a Sacrifice or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; what God has done, doth, or may do, for Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Nations, Perſons, or for the world, to cure this defect muſt be from his Grace, over and above the general and unlimited Commiſſion for publiſhing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the world</p>
                  <p>2. It's as good an argument, to aſſert that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the world was not loſt by <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, becauſe they did not (nor do not) know it nor can they know it, without the Divine and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Revelation; as to affirm, that the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> died not for them, becauſe they did not (or do not) know it; or to affirm, that he dyed not for all, or any part of the world that was dead and paſt before his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, becauſe they did not, nor could not hear there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and know it.

                  <p>The anſwer to this will lead us into the Third particular mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> The varieties of the ends deſigned by this one Sacrifice, with the certain ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of all the ends deſigned thereby, which will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirm the truth of his being a Sacrifice for the ſins of the world, thoſe who are of the narrow prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and Spirit, can ſee but one end deſigned in this undertaking, <hi>viz.</hi> To dye for the Elect only, and to damn all the world beſides. But we ſhall find in Scripture, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of Glorious ends intended thereby, ſome of which, muſt go before the Salvation of the Elect. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, there had been no Election or Salvation to any.</p>
                  <p>But this I would ſhould be eſpecially noted, that Gods love to the World in the gift of his Son; and Chriſt giving himſelf a Sacrifice for the life of the World, is the Baſis and Foundation of all Chriſtian Faith, and whatever things were deſigned thereby, is founded upon, and muſt have its ſpring and effecting, from this general Love, and general Sacrifice, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of which, tends to root up the Foundation of Goſpel, Faith and Salvation, as you may underſtand in that which followeth.</p>
                  <p>Now I come to ſhew the variety of the ends deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this one Sacrifice, and the ſutable advantages thereof, according to thoſe ends deſigned thereby.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By this one Sacrifice, Mankind and the whole World was continued and preſerved, in order to the Reſtitution of all things (which was deſigned thereby) without which Sacrifice (as lying in promiſe and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually taking place <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.) Both Man and the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61328:46"/> World had been ended by the firſt ſin and fall, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. 3. <hi>The Earth and all the inhabitants thereof are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, I bear up the Pillars thereof.</hi> It's not ſpoken of the Father, that is plain. <hi>verſ</hi> 2, 3. Then it muſt be of the Prophet, or of Chriſt, not of the Prophet, for he could not bear up the Pillars of the Earth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt intend Chriſt, <hi>by whom are all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 6. <hi>And by whom all things conſiſt,</hi> Col. 1. 17. <hi>Who lighteth every Man that cometh into the World,</hi> Joh. 1. 9. And that not only upon the account of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as <hi>it was made by him;</hi> but on the account of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, when by ſin it was diſſolved, if the promiſe of Chriſt a Sacrifice had not intervened; and therefore it's ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 8. That he <hi>was a Lamb ſlain, from the Foundation of the World,</hi> viz. His Sacrifice then to come, virtually took place to bear up the World, and by vertue thereof, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> has been (and ſhall be) preſerved <hi>to the Reſtitution of all things,</hi> Act. 3. 21. So that not only the Being of Mankind and the whole World is continued by this one Sacrifice, but likewiſe all the good that Men poſſeſs and enjoy in this World, is by vertue of this one Sacrifice, ſo that I may ſay in this matter, as the Apoſtle in a differing caſe, <hi>behold, I ſhew you a myſtery.</hi> Yet revealed by the Sacrifice himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 53. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no life in you;</hi> and that not only by Faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life Eternal, but unleſs we enjoy all the good things of this life, as coming to us by the Blood of Chriſt, this one general Sacrifice, we have not the Goſpel light and life in us. This is the firſt end and Effect of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Grace, by the general Sacrifice, that the ſin of the World is ſafer taken away thereby, as that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind and the whole World, is (and ſhall be) preſerved
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61328:46"/> and continued <hi>to the times of the Reſtitution of all things:</hi> and this was ſo great an end, as without which there could have been no Election or Salvation of any.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as an effect of this firſt deſign, was deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and effected, the Reconciliation of the World to God, and that not only to enjoy good things from God here, on the temporal account, but ſo far, as that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtands in the way to hinder the ſpecial Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and Salvation, but unbelief and diſobedience to the Goſpel, where the Goſpel comes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16, 19. That there is ſuch a univerſal Reconciliation thereby. See <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20 <hi>And having made peace by the Blood of his Croſs, by him to Reconcile all things to himſelf, I ſay, whether things in Heaven, or things in Earth,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19. <hi>God was in Chriſt, Reconciling the World to himſelf, not imputing their ſins.</hi> All Men are ſo far Reconciled to God by this one Sacrifice, as that nothing ſtands in the way to hinder their Salvation but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: <hi>Who ever will may come and take of this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Life freely,</hi> Rev. 22. 17. And by vertue of the ſame Sacrifice, who ever hath <hi>feared God, and wrought Righteouſneſs</hi> ſince the firſt ſin and fall, hath been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, before the Goſpel Grace was known in the World, as it's now made manifeſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 34, 35. Thus far the ſin of the World is taken away.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The whole is ſo far Reconciled to God by this one Sacrifice, and ſin not imputed, ſo as not to hinder the Reſurrection of all, and the Reſtitution, this being the great and univerſal end of God in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſin would have buried all in Oblivion for ever, but by this means, ſhall be a univerſal deliverance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 21, 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. And with Mankind, the Renovation and <hi>Reſtitution of all things,</hi> that fell by the ſin of the firſt Man. That as all fell by the Sin of the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61328:47"/> firſt Man, ſo ſhall all be Reſtored by the ſecond, which ſhall be the new World, or World to come, <hi>Heb. 2. 5, 8, 12. Pet, 3. 13. Rev.</hi> 21. 5. And on this account <hi>He gave his Fleſh for the Life of the World,</hi> Joh. 6. 51. In and over which ſhall be his Eternal Kingdom and Glory with his Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. &amp; 22. 5. And in this ſenſe alſo, he hath taken away the ſins of the World.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He dyed, for the Elect, for the Sheep, for the Church, <hi>Act. 28. 20. Eph.</hi> 5. 25. And as he dyed for them, ſo they ſhall have the ſpecial Benefit, Bleſſing and Salvation thereby, <hi>he is the Saviour of all, but eſpecially of them that believe,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 10. But this Salvation of the Elect of Believers, as it's certain, ſo it's founded in the general Grace, and in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sacrifice, ſo that we may ſafely conclude, that had there been no ſuch general Grace, nor general Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, there had been no ſuch thing as Election or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace to any, had not God compaſſed the World in this wonderful deſign of Grace, all had been loſt, by the firſt ſin and fall, and buried in Oblivion, and this univerſal deſign of Grace to the World, compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth and includeth all particulars; and that is it I ſay, that ſpecial Grace is founded in general Grace, that had there been no ſuch general Grace, to the World, there had been no ſpecial Grace and Salvation to any, therefore to out this general Grace and Sacrifice, is in it ſelf, really to out and end all the Grace and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By the Death, and Reſurrection of Chriſt was deſigned, and is, and ſhall be effected, the Lordſhip of Chriſt over all. It's true, he was Lord of all by right of Creation, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. But this Lordſhip by right of Redemption, muſt be arrived to by his ſuffering, as a Sacrifice for the Redemption of the World, becauſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61328:47"/> all was loſt, both Man and the World by the ſin of Man, and therefore without a Redemption, there would have been no Men, nor World to be Lord of, <hi>Rom. 14. 9. For this end, he dyed, and roſe and revived, that he night be Lord both of the Dead and of the Living.</hi> This was one end of his death, and ſuch (and ſo great) an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

And that he Mediates for all, further appears, in that he has made it our Duty <hi>to pray for all Men,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 1, 2. <hi>For Enemies, Perſecutors, and them that hate us, that ſo we may be the Children of our Heavenly Father,</hi> Mat. 5. 44, 45. And ſurely all Men, Enemies and Perſecutors, are not the Elect only, and we have no ground to believe that Chriſt has made it our Duty to Pray or interceed for any things, or Perſons, for which he will not Interceed
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61328:48"/> for, becauſe if we pray for any thing he will not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed for, how can we expect him to preſent ſuch pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as acceptable to the father? <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. 3. he died for the Elect, his Church and mediates for them. <hi>Rom. 8. 34. Joh.</hi> 14. 16. he died for the World, that he might be the viſible Lord thereof, and mediates for the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 2. 8, 9. tho this is ignorantly enough, applied to his meditation for the Elect, by ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing themſelves to be wiſe, which if ſo, and they ſhould prove to be ſome of thoſe Elect, they would much miſs of their expectation, <hi>it being to break them with a red of Iron,</hi> and to daſh them in pieces like a potters veſſel. The ſame as <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 26, 27. where the Elect Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comers, ſhall be with Chriſt in this breaking work, it being the Worlds portion in the Judgment, to be thus broken, before they obtain what of grace may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for them. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 82. 8. you may ſee more of this in <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>And as for his being heard in all things he mediates for, it's already fully granted, only this we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that in his mediation for men here, in order to believing and perſevering in grace, it is for a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of means and power for Effecting the end, and that he is heard therein, tho the end may not be Effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his mediation being an official mediation, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to do with capable ſubjects and not with brutes, and thoſe who aſſert that what ever he mediates for, ſhall be Effected in their ſenſe, do really (tho not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally) end all faith, Election and the mediation of Chriſt, in as much as (by this aſſertion) there are now no believers in the world, for he prayed for ſuch a viſible unity among all believers, as that the world might behold it, and be converted thereby. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 20, 21, 23. but there is no ſuch viſible union among
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61328:48"/> all believers, but rather ſuch viſible diviſions, that tends to harden and ſtumble ſinners, ſo that there are none of the believers yet in the world, for whom Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceeds; or we muſt underſtand it as I have ſaid, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they will have the <hi>Roman</hi> unity to be the matter intended: Which (ſuch as it is) is maintained by perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, maſſacres and blood, a union more ſuting brutes than chriſtian men. But we ſhall one day know, that the dreadful diviſions among profeſt Chriſtians, is not for wans of a mediator, but from our own ſinful ſelves.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. You may learn, what bad and ſad work they make, who deny the general grace of God to men, and the general ſacrifice of Chriſt for the world, caſting contempt and reproch thereupon, calling and accounting them adverſaries that believe and own it, when themſelves it is, that teach a doctrine and lay a foundation the Scripture knows not, <hi>viz.</hi> that God loved but a few only in the gift of his ſon, and that Chriſt died only for a few, and reprobated all the reſt to eternal deſtruction, ſo denying the Scripture, and root up the foundation of Goſpel faith and ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of the impoſſibility for any perſon thereby, to have any goſpel ground of faith and hope of ſalvation, tho they talk high, from fancy and imagination, but not from Scripture grounds, for from that notion, no man can have a Scripture ground of hope, it being ſo exceeding contrary to the goſpel and ſaith thereof, the ſaith of the goſpel, being that to which the promiſe is made (as I ſhall ſhew in the next Chapter) there can be no grounded hope of ſalvation out of the faith thereof.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:61328:49"/>3. It juſtifieth the practice, and taketh off the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, caſt upon ſuch as are inſtructed in the doctrine of the general grace of God to men, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are adverſaries to the truth, and are all for that doctrins and diſcourſe, as if their religion conſiſted wholly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; I ſay it's no marvel it is ſo, being the foundation of all Goſpel faith, and without it can be none in the truth thereof, even thoſe who oppoſe it are beholding to it, if they held to their own principles without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, it would appear to be the moſt irreligious and ridiculous in the world called Chriſtian, but they cannot preach to the world without the help of general grace, tho they preach it in the higheſt contradiction to their own principles, which if plainly preached to the people as held and printed would affright the people, and ſhame themſelves out of their work, If they ſhould tell the people that they bring them tidings of great joy to all people, that Chriſt dyed for the World, but it was but for a very few, the elect World only, and that all the reſt were reprobated before the world was, that they were made to ſin and be damned, and that they have no more power to believe unto life, than brute Beaſts, than a ſtock, or a ſtone, or a dead corps; and yet for all this, it's their duty to believe, and they muſt be damned the deeper in hell if they do not believe, and yet if they do believe, if they be not Elect, they are but Hypocrites and muſt be damned: This being the ſpirit and life of that principle, and of their goſpel in the plain truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which if they dealt honeſtly with their hearers, they ought to preach; it being their goſpel and faith, as in Print and diſcourſe is fully manifeſt, ſo that did they not mix their doctrine with general grace, tho not in love thereto (ſtanding in direct oppoſition thereof) to make it ſavory without which it would appear to be
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61328:49"/> loathſome unto all. And therefore the doctrine of the general grace of God by Jeſus Chriſt, being the alone foundation, ſavory and ſaving doctrine of the goſpel, Chriſtians inſtructed therein have no cauſe to be aſhamed of the reproach thereof, but to glorifie God in this behalf, and others may learn to be ſilent for ſhame, and will, when they underſtand the truth and worth of this glorious doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. You may learn from hence, where the difference about ſalvation and damnation lyeth (and why all are not ſaved; a matter it is of great and weighty concern unto all) and that is in believing or not believing the goſpel; it's faith and unbelief that makes the difference, and not the eternal decrees of Election and Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and want of a Saviour, as ſome unjuſtly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly aſſert, to the diſhonour of God, the Goſpel, and wrong of men. The condemnation will not be for want of love in God, or for want of a ſacrifice and Saviour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> but for mens wilful and choſen wickedneſs, and that they ſhall one day know. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16, 19. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let the fomenters of this unholy doctrine, be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, any more to lay the ſin and damnation of the World on the holy and righteous God, it being ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent from the word of the God of truth, that it's obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and diſobedience to the Goſpel that makes the difference, and not the want of a ſacrifice and Saviour.</p>
                  <p>3. It gives us to underſtand the vanity of that doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine that teaches Juſtification and Salvation by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditional Covenant; It's true that the general parts thereof, are wholly inconditional both in promiſe and performance (as before has been ſhewed) and that part only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that aſſureth ſalvation to ſinners, with <hi>Eternal glory,</hi> is conditional (which is alone pleaded for to be inconditional) I may ſafely ſay, there's no man on

                  <p>And further, it's ridiculous to apply thoſe promiſes made to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (as ſuch) to unconverted

                  <p>True faith, ever has been and ſtill is to believe God, and to cleave to him and obey him ſutable to the miniſtration under which men have lived in all ages. This was <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3. Abraham <hi>believed God, and it was counted to him for righteouſneſs. Jam.</hi> 2. 22. this being <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, <hi>the father of the faithful,</hi> the faith of his children muſt needs be the ſame. So then to believe the truth of the doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in all its parts, and to cleave to the Lord therein, is the faith of the Goſpel to which the life thereof is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. What the Goſpel preacheth to us, that we ought to believe, and that is the faith thereof.</p>
                  <p>The doctrine of the Goſpel conſiſteth eſpecially in theſe particulars. 1. That Jeſus Chriſt is the Meſſias promiſed, the Son of God and the ſon of man, the ſon
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61328:54"/> of <hi>David,</hi> of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the Scripture, <hi>Luk. 1. 32. Joh. 20. 31.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That God in love to the World ſent him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. and that he in love gave himſelf a ſacrifice and ranſom for the life of the world, <hi>Joh. 6. 51. 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 6.</p>
                  <p>3. That by virtue of his death and reſurrection, all ſhall be raiſed and reſtored to a new life and world, when he ſhall come again to <hi>raiſe and judge both the quick and dead, 1 Cor. 15. 21, 22. 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 1. at which time or times ſhall be <hi>the reſtitution of all things, Act.</hi> 3. 21. the new and reſtored world to come, in and over which with his ſaints, ſhall be his eternal Kingdom and glory; which will be <hi>the finiſhing of the Myſtery, ſpoken of by the holy Prophets,</hi> and then <hi>the time of this world ſhall be no more, Rev.</hi> 10. 6, 7. with chap. 11. 15. &amp; 22. 5.</p>
                  <p>4. That thoſe who believe and obey the Goſpel of this his grace and glory ſhall be ſaved, and thoſe who do not believe and obey him therein ſhall be damned; theſe being the great parts of the Goſpel, faith therein, and obedience thereto, muſt needs be the faith of the Goſpel to which the ſalvation thereof is promiſed.</p>
                  <p>More diſtinctly, as to the reſtitution, world to come, and the eternal kingdom of Chriſt therein, (tho all founded in that one ſacrifice) is ſo great and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal a part of the Goſpel, as that ſhort of it, &amp; without it is no Goſpel, nor glad tidings at all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19. all the promiſes both of grace and glory Iſſuing here, and as it is the great doctrine of the Goſpel, ſo it ſometimes was the common faith of ſaints, tho through the Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, now almoſt loſt out of the world; that it was the common faith, appeareth from theſe following grounds.</p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:61328:54"/>
                  <p>1. It was the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithful, and very probably ſo called, from his believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this general promiſe to the world, denoting that our faith muſt be the ſame, or elſe we are not his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; that this was his faith ſee <hi>Rom. 4. 13. the promiſe that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ould be the heir of the world, was not to</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>and his ſeed through the Law, but through the righteouſneſs of Faith.</hi> This his heirſhip to the world to come, was through his faith in the promiſe, which faith he had <hi>before he was circumciſed, v.</hi> 10, 11. and on this faith it was, he became <hi>the heir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the world, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all that do believe.</hi> We may well ſuppoſe, that if he had not believed God in his promiſe of a Son, and Seed, <hi>in whom all the Families of the Earth ſhould be Bleſſed,</hi> he had not arrived to that Bleſſing and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, of being the <hi>Heir of the World, and Father of all that Believe.</hi> Which muſt likewiſe be our Faith, if we will prove our ſelves to be his Children, and <hi>Heirs with him of the ſame World; according to promiſe,</hi> Rom. 4. 16. <hi>Gal. 3. 29. viz.</hi> To believe the truth of the promiſe relative to the World to come, and that the Son and Seed is come by whom all ſhall be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                  <p>3. It was the common Faith of the Prophets, <hi>the Reſtitution of all things, was ſpoken of by all the Holy Prophets ſince the World began,</hi> Act. 3. 1. And as I underſtand, by the Learned Readers of the <hi>Jewiſh Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,</hi> that the Reſtitution and World to come, was the common Faith of the <hi>Jews,</hi> expected to be effected by their Meſſias.</p>
                  <p>3. It's apparent, that in the Primitive time of the Goſpel, it was the Faith of all, both Miniſters and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Miniſters according to the Commiſſion Preached it, <hi>Act. 3. 21. Rom. 8. 19, 20, 21. Eph.</hi> 1. 10. And the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61328:55"/> People believed it; this is plain and apparent, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 13. Nevertheleſs we according to his promiſe, look for a new Heavens and Earth, wherein dwelleth Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> Verſ. 14. <hi>Wherefore, Beloved, ſeeing ye look for ſuch things,</hi> &amp;c. Here is all, both Miniſters and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we, and ye, all looked for this new World: and they could not look for what they did not Believe.</p>
                  <p>4. It's the Faith that's ſtated by our Lord in the Commiſſion, for Preaching the glad tidings, <hi>Mar. 16. 15, 16. Go ye into all the World, Preach the glad tidings to all the Creation.</hi> So the word is, tho ſome be ſo bold as to make a mock thereof, and yet would be accounted Goſpel Preachers, <hi>it's to all the Creation.</hi> And dare any to conclude, there is nothing of Divine Wiſdom in the Lords Words; or to charge him with having ſo little reſpect to his Church, as to ſtate the Goſpel Commiſſion, both for Preaching, Faith and Salvation, in ſo dark and dubious terms, as to need their help, to alter or amend it, and ſo making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Wiſer than the Lord.</p>

Not that he was to ſpeak to the Mountains and Hills, but to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and this is called <hi>a ſpeaking to the Mountains and Hills.</hi> And <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 21. aſſerts, <hi>That the Reſtitution of all things, was ſpoken of by all the Holy Prophets, ſince the World began:</hi> and the ſutableneſs of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Chriſt hereunto, is moſt plain, <hi>to Preach the Goſpel to all the Creation,</hi> that Men might underſtand and believe <hi>it and be ſaved,</hi> and the Practice of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles was ſutable to the Commiſſion, which ſhould be our Practice likewiſe, <hi>Act. 3. 21.

And as this was the Doctrine of glad tidings by the Commiſſion (from the Lord thereof) to be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, what muſt be the Faith, but to believe the Doctrine? <hi>He that Believeth and is Baptized ſhall be</hi>

So that in the Commiſſion we have the Doctrine and Faith of the Goſpel, to which the life thereof is promiſed, which is the general Reſtitution, and glad tidings to all the Creation, this being the Doctrine and Faith, <hi>that was once delivered to the Saints, and for which we ought garneſtly to contend,</hi> Jude <hi>verſ.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>The ſum of all is, to believe, <hi>That Jeſus is the Chriſt, the ſeed of Abraham in whom all the Nations of the Earth ſhall be bleſſed;</hi> The Son of God, and the Son of <hi>David,</hi> the true Meſſias promiſed; that God in love ſent him, and that he in love gave himſelf a Sacrifice <hi>for the life of the World,</hi> and is Raiſed and Aſcended into Heaven, in performance of his Mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry office for Men, and ſhall come again from thence <hi>to judg the quick and the dead, and to perfect the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of all things:</hi> and to bring in the New and Reſtored World, in and over which ſhall be his Eternal Kingdom and Glory, and that whoever do ſincerely believe and obey him in this his Grace, ſhall Live and Reign with him in his Glory, <hi>Mar. 16. 15, 16.

This is the ſubſtance of the Doctrine and Faith of the Goſpel, to which the Salvation thereof is promiſed, <hi>which was once delivered to the Saints;</hi> which Doctrine and Faith ſhould be more precious to us than our Lives.</p>

                     <hi>all Power is of God,</hi> that <hi>it's in him we live, move and have our being,</hi> Act. 17. 28.

                     <hi>I ſuppoſe that the great queſtion about this matter, is, whether God in the Goſpel affords a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Power (where it's publiſhed in the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) to believe and obey it unto Life.</hi>

                  <p>To this I ſay, That we have ſufficient grounds ſo to believe, excepting Infants, Idiots, and diſtracted Perſons, who have not the uſe and exerciſe of Reaſon; tho no Scripture ſaith it in expreſs terms, yet the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Truth of the Scripture ſpeaks it in fulneſs and plainneſs, as appeareth:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the conſtant converſe of God with Men ever ſince the Creation, not only in the perfect, but in the fallen ſtate, in making known his Will, and giving Laws to Men, both Precepts and Promiſes, eſpecially under the Goſpel, which is moſt to our caſe; and for us to imagine Men not to be ſutably Influenced by him, with underſtanding and Power, to anſwer his will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, no more than Brutes, (as ſome affirm) I think are Brutiſh thoughts of God, as well as of Men; it would
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61328:57"/> be greatly diſhonorable to Men, to give Laws to Brutes, of which they are not capable; much more diſhonora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is it to God, to affirm, that he gives Laws to Men, that are by him, made no more capable to perform them than Brutes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It appeareth, in that he blameth and puniſheth (and will puniſh) thoſe that wilfully tranſgreſs his Will, and pittieth and bemoaneth thoſe that Rebel againſt him, <hi>Pſal. 81. 13. Luk.</hi> 13. 34. And has made great promiſes to thoſe that believe and obey him; all which are rendred to be incredible, if Perſons be not capacitated by him to anſwer his will therein.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The contrary renders God to be unjuſt, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous in the Judgment, to puniſh Men for not doing what they could not poſſibly do through impotency and weakneſs: which are hard and untrue thoughts of the Righteous and Holy God. Impoſſible commands, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting no Duty, nor can the not performance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, juſtly incur any puniſhment, either from God or Man.</p>

                     <hi>But you know what is uſually ſaid in this matter,</hi> viz. <hi>That Men had once a power in</hi> Adam, <hi>and liſt it by tranſgreſſion, ſo that, tho Man hath lost his power to obey, yet God hath not loſt his right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi>

                  <p>This I know is a common Plea, but hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of weight in it. For, 1. Tho <hi>Adam</hi> had a power to have yielded perfect obedience to the Law of his maker, in his firſt and ſinleſs eſtate, yet he had not power then to believe and obey the Goſpel, (which is our command) neither was he capable thereof, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no need of a Saviour, it being no part of the Law given to him, neither could he obey it, therefore he could not loſe that which he had not, nor we in him;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61328:58"/> but indeed after his ſin and fall, and the promiſe of a Saviour (it being ſutable to his fallen needy Eſtate) he had power to believe the truth thereof, ſo that it's a vain pretence, of <hi>Adams</hi> loſs of what he had nor, and if we muſt needs have our power in him to believe and obey the Goſpel at all, it muſt be after his ſin and fall, when he needed a Saviour; and if ſo, let it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved when he loſt it, and that we loſt it in him.</p>
                  <p>2. If this ſuffice not, let it be proved, that ſince the firſt ſin and fall, God has given (or giveth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands) to the loſt power, and that he will Judge and Condemn Men, for not improving a power which they had not, but (as they ſay) was loſt long before When this is done, it will be of weight, but not till then,</p>
                  <p>3. As it's unſcriptural and irrational ſo to affirm, ſo it's greatly diſhonorable unto God, and his Goſpel-Grace to Men, and indeed nulls and ends it, rendering it to be no Grace at all, to ſuppoſe that after ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion and declarations of Goſpel-Grace to Men, in ſo wonderful a way, that he ſhould ſtate the obtaining an intereſt therein, to a power loſt for ſome thouſands of Years before, which is indeed, to ſtate it on impoſſible terms, is diſhonorable unto God, rendering his deſign in the Goſpel of his Grace to Men, to be but a Fable, and of none effect, yea to be pernicious, as a Trap or Snare to catch Men, inſtead of free Grace: to damn them for what they could not do; which diſhonorable, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and dangerous Notions are to be abhor'd by all that Love the Name and Honor of God, ſo that a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in Man to believe and obey the Goſpel, with the helps therein afforded, which is all of God, is without all juſt ground of doubt.</p>

                  <p>Yet, 2. To ſay the reaſon why Men believe not, is not becauſe they cannot, tho they cannot, is all one, as to ſay, the reaſon why a blind Man doth not ſee, is not becauſe he is blind and cannot, but becauſe he will not; and the reaſon why a dead Man doth not live, move and act, as living Men do, is not becauſe he cannot, tho he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, but becauſe he will not: eſpecially their Opinion being, that Men by Nature, are as dead, blind and unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to underſtand, move or act in Spiritual things, as a dead Corps, a ſtock or a ſtone is in Natural things; and alſo that God hath deſtinated them, that believe not by an Eternal and unchangeable Decree thereunto, which imports an impoſſibility for any ſuch to believe and be ſaved, being by Eternal Decree determined to Sin and be Damned, but that all Men are capable (with the common helps afforded of God) to believe and be ſaved, is moſt apparent, or elſe they could not (in Juſtice) be capable to be damned.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61328:59"/> and not weakneſs, that will prove to Condemnation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 19. As all Power is of God, the Power of all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both Natural and Spiritual, ſo in all the Will is left free, and not forced by any coercive Power, but by vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary choice; as in the loweſt, ſo in the higheſt things, the Will determins the choice which I think has been the underſtanding of Chriſtians throughout all Ages ſince the Primitive time of the Goſpel; and is indeed both Divine and Rational.</p>
                  <p>I know many cry out upon this as free Will, as if it were reproach enough to uſe that term in way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; but rightly underſtood, <hi>viz.</hi> That Men have a power from God to Will, and are left free for its exerciſe by him, and that it is his Will that they ſhould improve their power in Willing the beſt good, (not that they do Will it, then the work would be done;) this is moſt apparent from Scripture: to this purpoſe read and ponder well, <hi>Iſa. 55. 6, 7.

                  <p>By all which it appears, That it's no new Notion, that the miſcarriage of Men, is from their own wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not from weakneſs, they ſhall blame them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and not God, in their Cendemnation; that free Grace and free Will muſt ſtand together, (and indeed to deny the power and freedom of Will, is to deny all Grace, for it's no Grace, but a mock, if there be no power poſſibly to accept it,) and that thoſe that were contrary minded, in the more purer times, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Hereticks and Blaſphemers, and how they will acquit themſelves therefrom, that now own and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſame, it behoves themſelves well to conſider; and indeed were there no power in Men, to believe and obey the Lord, (which his common helps afforded) they could then be capable of neither Vice nor Virtue,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61328:60"/> but muſt be as the Brutes, without Sin, and how honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable this is, either to God or Man, is eaſie to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the weakeſt capacity.</p>
                  <p>Yet in this matter, two things had need prudently to be conſidered. 1. That it's not perfect and ſinleſs obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, that is required, or that Men are impowered to perform, but univerſal and ſincere, to the beſt of their knowledg and power, which anſwereth the Goſpel-Law, and is accepted of God in Chriſt. 2, Nor is it meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious obedience (imperfect cannot be meritorious) but ſuch as the Goſpel requires, as the terms of life, and way in which we muſt walk to Glory, ſo that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is wholly of Grace.</p>

                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:61328:60"/>
                  <p>The 3. Is a downright will-not, a wilful cannot, a reſolvedneſs to cleave to ſin, and ſelf inventions, <hi>Joh. 50. 40. You will not come to me that you might have life,</hi> Jer, 2. 25. <hi>But thou ſaidſt there is no hope no, for I have loved ſtrangers and after them will I go,</hi> And ch. 18. 12. <hi>But thou ſaidſt, there is no hope, but we will walk after our own devices, and will do every one the imaginations of his evil heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the cannot Chriſt ſpeaks of, muſt needs come under one, or ſome of theſe three, and that is, Cuſtom and Tradition, wilfulneſs united, by reaſon of which, the cannot takes place.</p>
                  <p>2. The manner of the Lords drawing is by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and that the next Verſe explains, <hi>every man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that hath heard and learned of the Father, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to me,</hi> Gods drawing is by means and Miniſtry; they muſt firſt <hi>hear and learn, and then come to Chriſt;</hi> but whoſe will not both hear and learn cannot come to Chriſt, which was the preſent caſe with the <hi>Jews,</hi> who inſtead of learning, murmured againſt his Doctrine, <hi>verſ. 41. 43.

I drew them with the Cords of a Man, with the bands of Love, I laid meat before them.</hi> God lays the good things of the Goſpel before Men, which has a natural tendency to draw Souls to Chriſt, and it's the wilful cannot that hinders.</p>
                  <p>It being ſo far from truth to affirm that Man has no power to will his own good (diſtinct from ignorance of what is for his good, cuſtomarineſs or wilfulneſs, or ſome other great temptation) that he has not power really to will his own hurt, God having placed that Law in nature (not only of Men, but of all ſenſitive Creatures) to will their own good and ſafety, ſo far as they underſtand it, and have not power from God, to Will the contrary, (but in the caſes mentioned) and

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61328:63"/> upon the underſtanding and reaſon, that in Judgment it makes its choice, or elſe converſion might be effected by an immediate power without the word of the Goſpel, which I think was never yet done; if any inſtance can be given of any perſon that has been converted, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt crucified that never heard of him, this will be much anſwered, but indeed it's contrary to the Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. and contrary to reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, becauſe no man can poſſibly believe and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, till he know what to believe, and from what, and to what to turn, <hi>Act. 26. 18. 1 Theſ.</hi> 1. 9, 10. It's true God can poſſibly work without means, which would be indeed miraculous, but in this matter he has not, nor does not, but the Goſpel is the only means deſigned of God for Goſpel converſion and faith, therefore <hi>Paul</hi> muſt have a miniſtry without him (tho from the mouth of Chriſt) for his converſion; if an immediate work with out means might have done it, <hi>Saul</hi> had been a ſit ſubject for ſuch a work, tho through his Ignorant and Blind-Zealous Perverſneſs, he was without the reach of the ordinary means, yet (tho in a more than ordinary way) Chriſt wrought upon him by his wordwithout him, to his underſtanding within him, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 4, 5, 6. what he heard and ſaw, affected his heart, and the work was done.</p>
                  <p>2.

                  <p>This Scripture is frequently uſed to prove that which it does not at all intend, it being ſo apparent, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the givings down of the Spirit in it's mighty works after believing, and not in the firſt work of converſion, it being the promiſe (and was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) that the ſpirit ſhould be given down abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly upon believers after believing, as clearly diſtinct from it's ſacred work in the Goſpel in begetting ſouls to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61328:64"/> the faith; ſee for this, <hi>Joh. 7. 38, 39, Act. 2. 38, 39. Eph.</hi> 1. 13. ſo that to apply the giving down of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit according to promiſe, after believing, to the firſt work of faith and converſion, is a very great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and miſtake.</p>
                  <p>2. The Apoſtle in that place intends not the giving down of the Spirit upon the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to whom he wrote (much leſs, to perſons in the firſt work of faith) it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evident that the Apoſtle throughout this chapter keeps, the diſtinction between himſelf, the miniſters with him, and the Church, as was uſual in his other Epiſtles, from <hi>v.</hi> 1. to 13. he ſpeaks to (but not of) the church, but of themſelves, diſtinguiſhed by We, Us and Ye, and <hi>v.</hi> 13. ſpeaks of the church, and from <hi>v.</hi> 16. to 19. ſpeaks of themſelves, and lets the church to know, <hi>the exceeding greatneſs of his power, to us ward who believe,</hi> i. e. to the Apoſtles, in the mighty gifts of the ſpirit, and works done by them, for confirmation of the truth of the Goſpel, according to <hi>Mar. 16. 17, 18. Heb.</hi> 2. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>3. I conclude that the work of faith and converſion of ſinners, is ſo far from being a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>racle (as ſome pretend) that it's rather a marvel that ſo few believe and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, certainly our Lord would not have <hi>marvelled at their unbelief, Mar. 6. 6. nor grieved for their hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart,</hi> if they could not have believed without a miraculous work, which he was able to have effected, <hi>Mar.</hi> 3. 5. It's true many believed on the ſight of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles done without them, but we read not of any mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle done within them to work faith, nor is the work of faith and turning to God at all called a miracle.</p>
                  <p>4. And from the whole, we have great cauſe to fear that the Spirit is much more talked of by us all, than known and enjoyed, either in it's operations in the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61328:64"/> Goſpel to converſion, or in its gifts according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and cauſe we have to mourn in the ſenſe thereof, that he ſhould be ſo much amongſt us in word and ſo little in Power.

                  <p>As to this matter, I do not queſtion. 1. But that ſome are ſo known of God and given to Chriſt, as to be ſupplyed with perſevering Grace, till they come to Glory, yet not as diſtinct from the power of willing their own good, and the conſtant exerciſe thereof, nor ſo as doth in the leaſt acquit them from their duty, or danger in neglect thereof, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27. this being a ſecret only known of God, that none might boaſt, and that all diligence may be given by all, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
                  <p>2. This conſidered, if we believe the Scriptures, there is danger of falling from Grace, and this is ſtated by the Lord of Grace and Life, and all his Apoſtles, who beſt knew the danger, and what Doctrine was moſt (and beſt) for our ſafety, and never taught the contrary, what ever ſome pretend. 1. By Chriſt to his own Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 3, to 7. verſ. 3. <hi>Now are you clean through the word which I have ſpoken to you,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 7.

Read and ponder well theſe Scriptures, which will fully wiſe you in this matter, and <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6. Where the Apoſtle ſtates a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of falling away of the Regenerate, ſuch as were

                     <hi>enlightened by the Goſpel, and had tasted of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and taſted of the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</hi> &amp;c.

                     </gap>rangers to thoſe Goſpel attainments) but from what ground I know not; it's certain Men can never fall from (or loſe) that they never had. Compare with this, <hi>chap.</hi> 12. 22, to 25. Where it's moſt apparent that Perſons that are come to the higheſt Goſpel-ſtate that it's poſſible for any to come to, now by Faith, yet are in danger to loſe all, and themſelves too, <hi>verſ. 25. See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh: for if they eſcaped not who refuſed him that ſpake on Earth, much more ſhall not we eſcape, if we turn away from him that ſpeaketh from Heaven.</hi> I know that ſome lightly and prophanely, make God's Ifs to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but they ſhall one day know, they are not in vain.</p>

                  <p>It's great ignorance and miſtake ſo to affirm, they may as well ſay, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught falling from Grace, becauſe they taught the danger of falling, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 12. Let him that thinketh he ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, take heed leſt he fall.</hi> And indeed, to teach the danger of falling, is the only way and means to prevent it; and thoſe who teach impoſſibility of falling, do really, though not intentionally teach People to fall, by neglecting their Watch and War, through Carnal and ungrounded ſecurity, which Doctrine has proved dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to many Souls. Suppoſe, two Families lived
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61328:67"/> by a dangerous River, the Parents of one warn their Children to take heed and beware, they fall not in, if they do. they will certainly be drowned, if ſome help at hand prevent not; the others likewiſe give warning of the danger, but withal, lets them know, that if they fall in, they may receive ſome wrong, but they ſhall not fear, for certainly they ſhall not be drowned; for they will ſo attend them, as to draw them out again, without any danger or fear of drowning: now which of theſe do really teach their Children to adventure on the danger of drowning, or to prevent it, is eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and ſo is it, in the preſent caſe.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>This ſeems much to the matter in hand, for they ſay Believers may fall grievouſly, and diſhonour God, and loſe their peace, but not hurt their Eternal Eſtate, not fall finally; that it's one thing to fall and break the Bones, and another to fall and break the Neck.</hi> Sovereignty. <hi>pag.</hi> 386.</p>

                  <p>I know that this is commonly ſaid, and that by them that might better underſtand, it being ſo plain a way to teach Men to grow careleſs, fearleſs, and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and indeed, to open the door to Apoſtaſie, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Doctrine that neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles taught, but the contrary; and from whence it's learnt I leave the owners thereof to account.</p>
                  <p>And notwithſtanding the honour of God ſhould be more to us than our lives, yet the duty and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is rarely (if at all) ſtated there, but on the danger, and that, not of loſing the Peace and that Conſolation, but the Salvation, <hi>Joh. 15. 6. If a man abide not in me, he is caſt forth as a Branch that withereth, and men gather them and caſt them into the fire, and they are burned.</hi> The danger is of fire and burning. So in all the Scriptures you may read as much; it's ſtated on
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:61328:67"/> the danger of Judgment, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 17. Heb.</hi> 2. 3. &amp; 12 25. Therefore it's a Scriptureleſs Notion, and vain fable, ſowing Pillows under mens Elbows, in hiding the danger from them.</p>
                  <p>It's true, that 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 19. is much urged to prove that none but Hypocrites can fall away, <hi>they went out from us, but they were not of us.</hi> And,</p>
                  <p>As to this, 1. I take it as a univerſal rule, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand no one Scripture contrary to all the Scriptures that ſpeak of the ſame matter. So then, we may not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>John</hi> in this place, contrary to all that Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſaid in this matter, who all agree, in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the danger of falling from Grace, unleſs we will conclude all to be Hypocrites.</p>
                  <p>2. We may not underſtand <hi>John</hi> ſo, as to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himſelf, who plainly ſtates the danger, and the way of ſafety and preſervation, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 28. &amp; 2 <hi>Joh. verſ.</hi> 8. In which he ſpeaks very much, as Chriſt did i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the ſame matter.</p>
                  <p>3. Therefore we may underſtand <hi>John</hi> to intend, either, 1. That they were not of them, when they went out from them, if they had, they would no doubt, have continued with him; he ſaith not, that they were not at all of them.</p>
                  <p>Or, 2. If they were not at all of them, but Hypo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crites (which is not affirmed) he might ſpeak in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Spirit, as ſometimes <hi>Peter</hi> did of <hi>Ananias, Act.</hi> 5. 3, 4. Which is no common rule for us; but that Perſons have, and may, fall from Grace, in this imperfect ſtate, is ſo apparent, (if we believe the Scripture) that it's paſt all juſt ground of doubt, and may warn us, <hi>not to be high minded but fear, Ro. 11. 20. 1 Tim. 1. 19. 2 Pet.</hi> 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>3. Yet, notwithſtanding, there is a way of ſafety and certain preſervation to the Glory promiſed, ſtated in the Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> If we, <hi>with purpoſe of heart cleave to the Lord,</hi> in the Faith, Love and Life of the Goſpel, in this way, he will accept us, aſſiſt and preſerve us to the Glory.

                  <p>The ſum of the whole is, let us look to our duty therein looking for (and believing) Divine acceptance and aſſiſtance therein, and God will not fail us, <hi>Pſal. 125. 1. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 5. But keep us ſafe to the Glory promiſed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 27, 28, 29. Where Chriſt ſtates

                  <p>It ſtands both with Scripture and Reaſon, that Gods Grace and our Duty unite, there being no promiſe of ſafety or Salvation, out of the way of Goſpel-Duty, <hi>Rev. 22. 14.

                  <p>That there is a Defilement in the Nature of Men (I ſuppoſe) is moſt Evident, and that both from Scripture and Reaſon. 1.

From Reaſon, which will tell us, that in as much as by the firſt tranſgreſſion we are fallen into a ſtate of weakneſs, mortality and death, our nature muſt needs be weak and Defiled, and ſo more liable to ſin than before, yet what the Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, and how far it extends it ſelf, is that which (I think) none can truly determine, yet I believe, it's not wholly free from Original Defilement, from the grounds mentioned; nor that it is (diſtinct from all occaſions of further Defilement) ſo bad as ſome do render it.</p>

                  <p>In this matter, it may be meet for us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. 1. How far concupiſcible nature was by creation and Gods ordinance, good and undefiled before the fall; and how far it ſo continues now in the fallen ſtate. And as to this, it's apparent, there was natural luſtings by creation in <hi>Adam,</hi> (in themſelves ſinleſs) and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful both before and ſince the fall; as, 1. To a married ſtate, which was lawful, and Gods ordinance, in the ſtate of innocency, before the ſin and fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 28. &amp; 2. 23, 24. and ſo continues lawful and Gods ordinance ſtill, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 4.

It's lawful to be angry; ſo was Chriſt, <hi>Mar.</hi> 3. 5. ſee, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 26. It was lawful both before the fall, and ſince, to think, meditate, ſpeak and act; in all which concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcible nature is exerciſed.</p>
                  <p>But the ſin is in breaking Gods allowed rules, in all theſe caſes, abuſing our ſelves, in tranſgreſſing by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs (in things in themſelves in their Original by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Gods ordinance good and lawful) as in adultery, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 4. gluttony, drunkenneſs, covetouſneſs, ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lying, evil ſpeakings, wrath, Murders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that (I think) I may ſafely ſay, that almoſt all Moral evils, conſiſt in out running of, and making a breach upon Gods allowed rules and law in nature, ſo that nature in its Original, was not, nor is not in it ſelf ſo bad a thing as ſome do render it, but as in <hi>Adam,</hi> and as ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in us, is in it ſelf (by Gods creation and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance) good and lawful; and it's the exceſs (through temptation) in which the ſin lyeth.</p>
                  <p>2. Then, the defilement is from the weakneſs of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf (as before I ſaid) it being in the fallen ſtate, <hi>Rom. 7. 24. O wretched man that I am, who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from this body of death?</hi> And hence, it's liable to further defilements by occaſions and temptations, if <hi>Adoms</hi> nature was ſo liable to temptation and defilement thereby, when pure and free, and he in full ſtrength of perſon and reaſon, and ſo more capable by far to reſiſt temptation than any ſince, it's no marvel if nature in the weak and mortal ſtate is by occaſions and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, more infected, eſpecially being upon its firſt try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in infancy, where capableneſs of reſiſting is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                  <p>I think it meet (and according both to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reaſon) that we diſtinguiſh in the nature of man, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is a two fold nature in man, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and Senſitive, that which I call rational is that wherein man differs from other ſenſitive creatures; the Senſitive, is that part of the ſoul, which is the life of (and animates) the body, as in other creatures, and is by ſome called the concupiſcible, lower or worſer part of the ſoul, which is only capable of luſtings, and ſuch like ſutable, natural motions and Actions, in and with the body, as in other creatures, and it is in this ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive concupiſcible part of the ſoul (as in conjunction with the body) in which the luſtings after evil lyeth, and the enmity to that which is good, by reaſon of which men become the children of wrath. And hence it is, that thoſe who follow the unlawful luſts of this ſenſitive part of the ſoul, are called ſenſual perſons, <hi>Jam. 3. 15. Jude. v.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>The Rational part of mans nature, is that wherein he was (eſpecially) made in the image of God, which conſiſted not only in rule and government (as ſome ſay) but in a capableneſs thereunto, by reaſon and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which is ſtill in its remainders, the glory of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61328:72"/> man, which reaſon ſhould rule the lower and worſer part of the ſoul (and body likewiſe;) and when, and where any Moral good is found, it's when, and where this better part of the ſoul prevails, from whence all Moral good among men is, by divine creation and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination; and ſuch is its created excellency, that if men lived purely to it, there would be no need of Human Laws among men (Human Laws, being but as an help to keep this ſenſitive Nature in ſubjection, for common ſociety among men) it would teach men to do, as they would be done unto; and this we may ſuppoſe to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in <hi>Adam,</hi> before his ſin and fall, and Nature in this ſenſe, is not ſo bad, in it ſelf, as ſome do render it, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that without which we could not be rational Men, but as the Brutes (as ſome affirm;) nor could we ever have been Chriſtian Men.

                  <p>The ſenſual Nature is ſpoken of in ſuch Scriptures as theſe, <hi>Rom. 1 26, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nature in this ſenſe, is frequently called, Carnal and Fleſh, and <hi>that which is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be,</hi> Rom. 8. 7. But the rational part ſhould rule it, becauſe that from Nature, as thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, ariſe all the unlawful Luſts and Actions of Men, which if Reaſon did rule, would prevent much.

There being a Lawful ſinleſs uſe thereof, which God alloweth, yea and commandeth, but the abuſe thereof is the ſin, in breaking Gods allowed rules, which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Conſcience, (much more Chriſtianity) ſhould regulate and order, according to Divine rule; but alas, this unruly part of Nature, not only captivates Reaſon, but even Perſons profeſſing high in Chriſtianity, are too often ſhamefully captivated thereby, and the moſt ſerious and ſincere Chriſtians, have their groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and complainings by reaſon thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24.</p>

                  <p>1.

                  <p>This I have largely ſpoken to, in my anſwer to Mr. <hi>Coxe, ch.</hi> 7. Yet I ſhall at preſent ſay ſomething briefly further to it, for your preſent ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is a World to come, is ſo plainly ſtated in the Scripture, as that (I think) none dare deny it, <hi>Mat. 12. 32. Mar. 10. 50. Eph. 1. 21. Heb.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:61328:79"/>2. What this world to come is, or ſhall be. 1. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively what it is not. 1. It is not heaven above which is Gods throne, as ſome vainly think and teach. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe that is already, and probably has been from Eternity, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 11. 4. and 93. 2. but this is not, but is a world that is yet to come, and ſhall be in the times appointed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe heaven is in Scripture, no where called the world to come, nor indeed could be ſo called becauſe it has been (and is) in being, but the World to come is not yet in being, otherwiſe than in purpoſe and promiſe, nor is heaven above (which is called Gods throne) at all called world, or any part of the created world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt when he came into the world, is not ſaid to come out of (or down from) the world to come, but that he came out, from God and down from heaven, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 38. &amp; 16. 30, &amp; 17. 8.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When he aſcended, he is not ſaid to aſcend up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World to come, but that <hi>he aſcended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and up where he was before,</hi> Mar. 16. 19. Joh. 6. 62.</p>
                  <p>2. It is not this preſent world, as others do as vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagin, that it is the Goſpel day of Grace now in this world; that this is not it, the reaſons are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This world was in being, long before the world to come was ſpoken of and promiſed, but that is a world that is not yet in being, but is to come.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe that where the world to come is ſpoken of it's clearly in way of diſtinction from this world, <hi>viz.</hi> this world and that which is to come, clearly diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into two worlds, one preſent, and another as yet to come. <hi>Eph. 1. 21. Mar. 10. 30. Luke</hi> 18. 30.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:61328:80"/> this is called the preſent world, importing a future World as yet to come. <hi>Gal. 4. 4. Tit.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe the eternal life promiſed in the Goſpel, is to be enjoyed in the World to come, <hi>Mar. 10. 30. Luk.</hi> 18. 30. and I think, but f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe the inheritance promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed <hi>(viz.</hi> believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> as well as <hi>Jews)</hi> is to be the heirs of the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13, 16. but neither <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> nor believers, have been, are not, nor are like to be, the heirs of this world, therefore it muſt be in the world to come, that the promiſed inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 5. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 8, 9, 13. So that as it appears that the promiſed inheritance, arrived to by faith, ſhall be poſſeſt in the World to come, ſo it's as apparent that neither, the higheſt Heaven, nor this preſent World, is the World to come, nor tho promiſed inheritance of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed.</p>
                  <p>2. Affirmatively, what the world to come is, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what it ſhall be when it is come, and in this the Scripture is as clear and apparent. 1. It's called <hi>a new Heaven and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 13. <hi>the making of all things new,</hi> Rev. 21, 5. <hi>the reſtitution of all things,</hi> Act. 3. 21. <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,</hi> Mat. 19. 28. the reſtoring, renewing, &amp; return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the World to its former eſtate, yea and far better than under the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, it will not be a new creation of what was not, but a renewing and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the old, ſuch a diſſolution ſhall paſs on the whole, as ſhall effect a change. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. 12. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 11. 12. ſo that it will be a <hi>waking all things new,</hi> and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. That Chriſt ſhall have a viſible Kingdom, as upon the throne of his father <hi>David,</hi> is moſt apparent from the Scriptures. We may ſay in this, as <hi>Heb. 10. 7. It is written in the volume of the book, Iſa. 9. 7. Act. 2. 30. Pſa. 132. 11. Jer. 23. 5. &amp; 33. 14. Luk. 1. 32, 33. v.</hi> 69. 70. the kingdom of Chriſt as <hi>Davids</hi> ſon, and as upon his throne, is fully and plentifully proved from the Divine revelation thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That this kingdom of Chriſt as upon the throne of <hi>David,</hi> ſhall firſt and principally be (to and) over the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they ſhall be firſt and chief in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as he is <hi>Davids</hi> ſon and ſucceſſor. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23, 5, 6. &amp; 33. 14, 15, 16. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 21. to 25.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That this kingdom ſhall be over all the world, as well as over the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael. Dan. 7, 14. Rev. 11. 15. Phil.</hi> 2. 9, 10.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It ſhall be in and over the World to come, that this viſible, glorious Kingdom of Chriſt ſhall be, and not in this world, and this appears. 1.

                  <p n="1">1. In that he is ſat down now, on his fathers throne in heaven, is a great dignity and glory, yet not ſuch, as when he ſhall ſit on his own throne; his father <hi>Davids</hi> throne is given to him and therefore properly called his own, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 32. hence, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 21. he calls it <hi>my throne</hi> and this is never ſaid of his fathers throne in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that it was given to him, or that he called it his own throne, he being to ſit there, but till his enemies be made his footſtool, that is, till he come to his own throne and kingdom, of which he <hi>is in Expectation, Heb.</hi> 10. 13. yet in this his kingdom will the father reign in and by him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 27, 28. ſee this more full, confeſſion of faith <hi>pag.</hi> 35, 36, 37, 38.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It ſhall be a viſible kingdom, dignity and glory, his kingdom now is much inviſible as to men, his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon altogether inviſible, and his government much vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and hid from the world, and but little thereof appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by, and ſeen among his people, but then it ſhall be an open, viſible and manifeſt Kingdom, Government and Glory, <hi>Rev. 1. 7.

                  <p>That the Generality of the Natural ſeed of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be ſaved is moſt apparent from theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture grounds following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe, God always owned them for his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as in the beſt, ſo in their worſt condition, both of Sin and Judgment, that he owned them for his own <hi>People and Portion,</hi> that their <hi>provocations were the Provocations of his Sons and of his Daughters,</hi> in their worſt ſinning ſtate, and he loſed not his Propriety
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61328:83"/> in them is moſt apparent, <hi>Dent. 32. 19. Pſ. 81. 8. Hear, O my People, and I will teſtifie unto thee,</hi> v. 11. <hi>But my People would not hearken to my voice,</hi> Iſrael <hi>would none of me, Iſa.</hi> 1. 3. Iſrael <hi>doth not know, My People doth not conſider,</hi> and <hi>ch. 58. 1. Shew my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple their ſins,</hi> &amp;c. By all which it appears, they were owned of God to be his <hi>own People, his Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Portion and lot of his Inheritance, Deut.</hi> 32. 9. In their worſt and ſinning Eſtate, and therefore, tho he Judged and Puniſhed them ſeverely, yet we have no ground to conclude, that he will Eternally Damn them, being his own People; and ſo they own themſelves to be, <hi>Iſa. 64. 9. We are all thy People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He owned them for his own People, when they were under his Judgment and Wrath, for ſin, <hi>Pſ. 78. 62. He gave his People alſo to the Sword and was Wroth with his Inheritance,</hi> v. 63, 64. <hi>Iſa. 5. 13. Therefore my People are gone into Captivity, becauſe they have no knowledge, ch. 47. 6. Jer. 5. 7. Ezek.</hi> 21. 12. All fall to the ſame purpoſe, ſo that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, their ſin and Judgment, yet they were ſtill <hi>his People, his Portion, his Inheritance, the pretious</hi> Sons of <hi>Sion, Lam. 4. 2. The precious Sons of</hi> Sion, comparable to pure Gold, how are they eſteemed as Earthen, Veſſels, yea, in and through all, they were <hi>the beloved of his Soul, Jer. 12. 7. I have forſaken mine Houſe, I have left mine Heritage, I have given the dearly beloved of my Soul, into the hand of her Enemies.</hi> They were the Lords Heritage and dearly beloved, Notwithſtanding all their Sin and Judgment, and this particular Intereſt, and Relation that God ſtill owned, was from the Covenant of Election and choiſe that God made with their Fathers, <hi>Exo. 32. 13. Pſ. 106. 45. Rom.</hi> 11. 27, 28. And this Relation to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61328:83"/> God in their worſt ſinning and Judged Eſtate, is owned and pleaded by the Prophet as perſonating them, <hi>Iſa. 63. 16. Doubtleſs thou art our Father, tho</hi> Abraham <hi>be Ignorant of us and</hi> Iſrael <hi>acknowledg us not, yet thou, O Lord, art our Father,</hi> See, <hi>ch.</hi> 64. 7, 8, 9. And we may ſafely conclude that God will never Eternally damn, the precious Sons of <hi>Sion,</hi> his own Children, the dearly beloved of his Soul, tho he ſeverely puniſh them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Tho he made uſe of Inſtruments to puniſh them for their ſins, yet they doing of it cruelly, and diſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, he reproved them and Judged them for it, it was not for doing thereof (becauſe appointed by him) but for their ill doing of it, <hi>Iſa. 47. 6. 7. Amos. 1. 11. Ob.</hi> v. 10. <hi>to 15. Zec.</hi> 1. 15.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And after all (and as an Effect of this continued Relation, intereſt and pitty in and towards them) he has made to them, many great and precious promiſes of their return and Salvation in the times appointed, and that to the very ſame ſinning and Judged People, the ſame that he owned, loved and pittied when he Judged them for their ſins, and not only their ſeed, or poſterity, that might be of them, ſome Thouſands of years after, as has been Imagined, but to the ſame People to whom the promiſes were made, <hi>after he had recompenſed them double for their ſin, Jer.</hi> 16. 16, 17. 18. v. 14, 15. is a promiſe of deliverance, yea <hi>to all of them; Ezek. 20. 40. For in mine Holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaith the Lord; ſhall the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>all of them, ſerve me,</hi> &amp; ch. 39. clears it ſo plain as may ſilence all Objections ch. 36. 10. <hi>I will multiply men upon you, all the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>even all of it,</hi> and ch. 30 about this matter, and that both as to the perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:61328:84"/> and the time of Effecting thereof. 1. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons concerned, and that is, the ſame that fell by the Sword for their Iniquities, v. 23. <hi>For their Iniquities, ſo fell they all by the Sword,</hi> v. 25. <hi>Now will I bring again the Captivity of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and have mercy upon the whole Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, v. 26. <hi>After they have born their ſhame, and all their Treſpaſſes whereby they have Treſpaſſed againſt me, when they dwelt in their own Land and none made them afraid.</hi> So that, they are the very ſame People that ſometimes dwelt ſafely in their own Land, and for their ſins were deſtroyed by the Sword, and not their poſterity only that never dwelt ſafely there, that are here intended; and this is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that the promiſe is to the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not of <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> becauſe <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> went out from thence, but to the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whoſe whole poſterity was under the Promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 2, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>2. And as for the time of this return and Salvation, it ſhall be at and after the deſtruction of <hi>Gog.</hi> the laſt and great Enemy, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38 &amp; 39, <hi>Chapters.</hi> And of this Salvation we may ſee, <hi>Amos 9. 3.

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. And then it's no marvel, the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Rom. 11. 26. That all</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Of which I have ſpoken in my Anſwer to <hi>Mr. Coxe, ch.</hi> 7. To which Salvation of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not only all the Scriptures Mentioned, agree, but, <hi>Iſa. 45. 17. Jer.</hi> 30. 10. &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 21, 22, 23. with many more; to which Promiſes we may conclude the Apoſtle relates, when he ſaith, <hi>v. 27. This is my Covenant with them, when</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:61328:84"/> 
                     <hi>I ſhall take away their ſins;</hi> this is the Covenant after they had born their Puniſhment for their ſins, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 52, 58. &amp; 37. 26.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This univerſal Salvation ſhall be after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Judgment is over, or elſe it could not reach them all, but it ſhall be when they are raiſed up and come all of them: and in this the Scripture is as expreſs, as to the Salvation it ſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. 8. The time when God <hi>will take away the rebuke of his People from off all the Earth, is, when he doth ſwallow up Death in victory;</hi> Which words the Apoſtle applyeth to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 54. Then ſhall he bring to paſs that ſaying that is written, Death is ſwallowed up in Victory,</hi> Iſa. 26. 19, 20, 21. <hi>Thy dead Men ſhall live, together with my dead Body ſhall they ariſe; awake and ſing ye that dwell in the duſt, for thy dew is as the dew of Herbs, and the Earth ſhall cast out the dead,</hi> ch. 49. 6. <hi>It is a light thing that thou ſhouldeſt be my Servant to raiſe up the Tribes of Jacob, and to reſtore the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,</hi> (or deſolations) <hi>of Iſrael,</hi> And <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 10, 11, 14. and 39. 23, 25. plainly declares the time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. So <hi>Zech. 10. 9. They ſhall live with their Children and turn again.</hi> So <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. is, 1. A diſcovery of their Sin and Judgment, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2, to 9. 2. A promiſe of help, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, &amp; <hi>verſ. 10. I will be thy King,</hi> &amp;c. But how can this be, when he had deſtroyed them? See the time when it ſhould be, <hi>verſ. 14. I will ranſom them from the power of the Grave, I will Redeem them from Death: O Death I will be thy Plague, O Grave I will be thy Deſtruction, Repentance ſhall be hid from mine Eyes.</hi> Here is an abſolute promiſe to thoſe People, of which God will not repent, and this Scripture the Apoſtle applyeth to the Salvation of all <hi>Iſrael, Rom. 11. 29. The gifts and callings of God are without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:61328:85"/> viz. He will never repent of the Promiſes and Salvation made to thoſe People, and the ſame Apoſtle applyeth the ſame Scripture, to the Reſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 54. All which makes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 10, to 14. plain unto us. So that, the time of this general Salvation of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is plainly and fully ſtated in the word of Truth, to be at and after the Reſurrection and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>when the deliverer ſhall come from God out of Sion, and turn away ungodlineſs from Jacob, this is the Covenant with them, when he ſhall take away their ſins.</hi> Rom. 11 26, 27.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To them then, ſhall be Repentance for ſin, <hi>Ezek. 16. 61.

                  <p>This ariſeth much from Tradition, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the Reſtitution and World to come, while the Faith of the Goſpel is loſt, as to the Glorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of God to the World by Jeſus Chriſt in the Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, it's no marvel they are all for Hell and burning in another World, while they conclude themſelves to have no ſhare therein; tho it's true, there will be ſire and burning enough, and that to thoſe who have the leaſt ſhare therein, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 48. And good it will be to all, to look well to themſelves in time, and come right in the Faith and Life of the Goſpel, leſt their <hi>own fire devour them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Let men come right in the Faith, as to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, World to come and Kingdom of Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (without which we have not the Faith of the Goſpel) and the difference in this will quickly end, when that is believed, the difference only remains about the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtates of men in that World, which (I ſuppoſe) may well be born withal in each other, eſpecially it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, that we all muſt come ſhort in the knowledge thereof till the time comes.</p>
                  <p>3. And concerning Redemption from Hell, the word tranſlated Hell, frequently in the old Teſtament (and ſometimes in the New) intends the Grave, and from thence ſhall be a univerſal Redemption of all, it being one of the proper ends of the Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt, <hi>Rom. 5. 18. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 21, 22. And is called the day of Redemption, <hi>Rom. 8. 23. Eph.</hi> 4. 30.</p>
                  <p>2. Sometimes, Hell intends great and deep aſſlicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſorrows, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 4, 5. &amp; 116. 3. From which has been (and may be) deliverance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 8. &amp; 86. 3.</p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:61328:96"/>
                  <p>3. The Whales belly is called Hell, which is rarely mentioned in the Old Teſtament, probably becauſe the old Covenant (as ſuch) could not bring in the ſecond life, without which could have been no ſecond Death, and it's called Death Metaphorically and not properly, the firſt Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being properly Death, the ſecond not ſo, but a life in miſery, called Death and Hell, which great and deep afflictions, pains and ſorrows (called Hell) do moſt ſutably repreſent.</p>
                  <p>And as there has been (and ſhall be) a Redemption from Hell, in all the firſt mentioned reſpects, <hi>viz.</hi> Out of great and deep afflictions, pains and ſorrows, of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> out of the Fiſhes belly, and all ſhall be Redeemed from the Grave, called Hell; why we ſhould be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous of, and affrighted with, a Redemption from the pains and ſorrows of the ſecond Death, called Hell, to me ſeems ſtrange, eſpecially the Scripture being ſo abundantly full and clear in the matter in the true ſenſe thereof, as before has been ſhewed, and as for the Kings of the Earth at that day relative to this matter, read and ponder, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 21, 22.</p>
                  <p>And as for the Redemption of the World, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance after Judgment (which includes the Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from Hell, beſides what has been already ſaid) we may read as much, in that wonderfully miſtaken Scripture, <hi>Pſal. 2. 8, 9. Ask of me, and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance, and the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of the Earth for thy poſſeſſion,</hi> where is, 1. Chriſts mediatory office, reſpecting the World, <hi>ask of me.</hi> 2.

                  <p n="1">1. If there were no worth at all (nor advantage) in the knowledge of the Glorious deſign of God to the World by Jeſus Chriſt in the Reſtitution and World to come, certainly he would not have filled his word with the diſcoveries thereof as he has, he would not have made it the work of <hi>all his holy Prophets ſince the World began to ſpeak thereof,</hi> but to the end that we might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and believe it to his praiſe, <hi>things revealed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to us,</hi> Deut. 29. 29. There being no truth in the Scripture more fully and frequently declared, than the Reſtitution and World to come, with the Glories there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. I think I may ſay, the Scriptures abounds and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels in this, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 21.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61328:98"/> times before, and after the ſufferings of Chriſt much differed, afterwards Chriſt did not forbear the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that to them, which they were not capable to bear before he ſuffered, nor did the Apoſtle forbear the publiſhing of further truth to <hi>them that were dull of hearing, Heb.</hi> 5. 11. with <hi>ch.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle complains, <hi>that he was become</hi> (or eſteemed) <hi>an Enemy becauſe he told them the truth,</hi> Gal. 4. 16. And indeed, a ſin and a ſhame it is, that any profeſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould be offended at the Doctrine <hi>of the Reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all things,</hi> the World to come, with the Glories thereof, it being the Crowning part of the Glorious Goſpel of the Bleſſed God.

                  <p>In this, I ſhall endeavour to clear three things of weighty concern, in order thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God hath, doth and will, Tabernacle and Sanctuary himſelf with men, and dwell among them; and as to this, (beſides his manifeſting himſelf by his works, <hi>Pſal. 1. 2, 3. Rom.</hi> 1. 19, 20.) we find a four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold dwelling of God with men declared in Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, the firſt three being but a preparation to the fourth, in which will be the perfect Glorious preſence Eternally.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt, he did Gloriouſly, (yet figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9.) Sanctuary himſelf in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tabernacle and Temple, by himſelf ordained and appointed for that end, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 8. &amp; 29. 44, 45, 46. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 13. &amp; 8. 13.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His Sanctuarying himſelf in his Son, in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, unconceivable, unſpeakable and Glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 16. Col.</hi> 2. 9. And hence, he himſelf (alluding to the Figurative Temple) calls himſelf <hi>the Temple, Joh.</hi> 2. 19, 21. As God of old dwelt in the Temple, ſo now in a more wonderful way he dwek in his Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 10, 11. &amp; 10. 38. And in this way, God in Chriſt dwelt among men while he was in the World. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt being in Perſon aſcended to his Father, now in the Goſpel day of Grace, he dwelleth in and among his People by his Word and Spirit, and in this way manifeſts himſelf to the World. 1. By his Word and Ordinances, <hi>Joh. 15. 7. Col. 3. 16. 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 24. 2. By his Spirit, in and with his Word in unity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">4. And as the finiſhing of his Figurative dwelling among his People of old, and the preparations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61328:99"/> by his dwelling in his Son, and ſince, in, and among, his People, he will Sanctuary and Tabernacle himſelf and dwell among men moſt Gloriouſly in the World to come, but then it will be in and with his Son, which in his firſt appearing in his Humiliation ſtate was a preparation thereunto, and this Glorious dwelling of God among men (which will be the Crowning Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his whole Goſpel deſign towards men) is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophets, <hi>Iſa. 12. 6. Ezek. 37. 26, 27. Zec.</hi> 2. 10, 11. And ſhewed to <hi>John</hi> in Viſion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 3. Which Viſion we have ground to believe, was preſented to <hi>John</hi> as the fulfilling of the promiſes that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thereof, and as it ſhall be performed when the time is come.</p>
                  <p>2. That this Glorious dwelling of God, in and with Chriſt among men, will be eſpecially and principally, in the Holy City that ſhall come down from God out of Heaven, when his Tabernacle ſhall be with men.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I ſuppoſe one great doubt about this matter is, whether it be a material City, or the Church, that is there intended, I think, moſt has and does underſtand it to be the Church, and not ſuch a City as you mention, becauſe it's called,</hi> Rev. 21. 9, 10. <hi>The Bride the Lambs Wife.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Min.</speaker>
                  <p>This being the great doubt in this matter, I ſhall endeavour the clearing thereof, and that I doubt not but with evidence of truth and; doing of which I ſhall obſerve four things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this City is frequently ſpoken of in the Scripture, as Glorious, and as the Saints expectation, <hi>Pſal. 87. 3. Heb.</hi> 11. 10, 16. &amp; 12. 22. &amp; 13. 14. So that this City and the expectation thereof, is no new notion, but of ancient expectation.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:61328:100"/>2. That this City is ſpoken of in Scripture clearly in diſtinction from the Church, and to be above in Heaven. <hi>Gal. 4. 26. Jeruſalem which is above is free which is the Mother of us all,</hi> ſo called becauſe we are begotten from thence by the Goſpel. <hi>Of us all,</hi> who are the Children and Church, as diſtinct from the City, ſo <hi>Heb. 11. 10. 16. He hath prepared for them a City,</hi> where the City is diſtinguiſhed from them for whom it is prepared, and 12. 22. <hi>The City of the living God, the Heavenly</hi> Jeruſalem, is mentioned as clearly in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction from the Church, <hi>verſe</hi> 23. ſo <hi>chap.</hi> 13. 14. is the City diſtinct from thoſe <hi>that ſeek</hi> after it, and <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27. The City is mentioned as diſtinct from thoſe <hi>that ſhall enter into it,</hi> and the Scripture clearly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents us with a City (or habitation) in the Heavens, of which the Old Teſtament, Tabernacle and Temple were the pattern, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 5. &amp; 9. 1, 2, 9, 23. By which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that thoſe former things were Figures and Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of things in the Heavens, and I take <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 2, &amp; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. To intend the ſame thing; in both which, the houſe is diſtinct from thoſe that ſhall dwell therein.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I fully grant that the Church may be and is called the City, <hi>i. e.</hi> after the name of the City, tho improperly, the place is properly the City, old <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> was properly the City, yet the People that dwelt therein were ſo called from that name, <hi>Jer. 13. 27. Luk.</hi> 13. 34. So that both City and Church are included therein, and in this ſenſe it is, the City is called the Bride the Lambs Wife, relative to the Church in the City, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 14.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I query, where ever there was a People called by the Name of a City, that never was in being, but deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Name from the City? Where ever there had
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61328:100"/> been a People called <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> had there been no ſuch City, or <hi>London,</hi> had there been no ſuch City as <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don?</hi> So what reaſon there is for any to ſuppoſe a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be called <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> were there no ſuch Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; eſpecially the Scripture being ſo plain and expreſs in the matter; It's true that thoſe who build a City, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily give the Name, and then the Inhabitants are called after that Name; he that built this City is God, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 1. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

New Jeruſalem,</hi> although but the Citizens, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 19. It being ſo, that Chriſt and the Saints ſhall have, not only Glory, but a Glorious place, it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe. And why ſhould we be ſo incredulous herein, the place being ſo plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Scripture?</p>
                  <p>3. That this City, the new and Holy <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhall <hi>come down from God out of Heaven,</hi> into the new and reſtored World, and ſhall be the Glorious habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, in and with Chriſt and the Saints Eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in which ſhall be the Throne of Chriſt's Kingdom as the Son of <hi>David,</hi> whoſe Throne was in (or very near unto) the old <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a Figure of this Glory, which <hi>ſhall be the Glory and Joy of the whole Earth,</hi> Pſal. 48. 1, 2. &amp; 97. 1.

                  <p>Not only in all the caſes before mentioned, but 1. That there is no ſuch thing as love in God at all; that that which is called love in God, is but a meer act of his will, as <hi>in Death of Death,</hi> p. 92. <hi>That God hath any natural or neceſſary inclination, by his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or any other property, to do us good, we deny; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that concerns us, is an act of his free will,</hi> p. 201. on <hi>Joh. 3. 16. God ſo loved the World,</hi> &amp;c. he ſaith, <hi>Our Adverſaries agree, that a natural affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and propenſity in God to the Creature, loſt under ſin in general, is intended by love; we on the contrary, that by love here, is not meant an inclination or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity of his nature, but an act of his will, wherein his love is ſealed, an eternal purpoſe to do good to men,</hi> p. 203. <hi>If the Lord ſhould not ſhew mercy and be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out to the creuture, meerly upon his own diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing will, but ſhould be naturally moved, to ſhew mercy to the miſerable, he ſhould, firſt, be no more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to men than to devils; nor, ſecondly, to thoſe that are ſaved than to thoſe that are damned; for that which is natural, must be equal in all its operations; and that ſome look on love in God as an unchangeable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ffection; but the truth is, as an affection or paſſion, it hath no place at all in God; certainly then, in God,</hi>
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:61328:111"/> 
                     <hi>his love is but a pure act of his will, his good pleaſure, not a natural affection to the creature, no ſuch affection is in God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this contradicts not, and gives not the lie, to all the Scriptures, that declare the love of God to men, and ſtrikes not a death on them all, I know not what does: What! no love, no affection in God towards men? No natural affection, propenſity or inclination, from his goodneſs, or any other property, to do good to men? That this has no place in God, but only will and purpoſe, but no love. Had he ſaid ſo much of the Devil, I think he had ſaid right, for he has no love, no affection or inclination to do good to men; and had he power (as God) to make men, he might, (as the ſaying is) be good to ſome from his will, tho' no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity or inclination in him moving him thereunto: thus the love of God to men is ended, and the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures that ſpeaks thereof belyed; the Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo far from this (for ever to be rejected) Doctrin, that it ſaith, Joh. 3. 16. <hi>That God ſo loved the World, that he gave his Son,</hi> &amp;c.

                        </gap> rich in mercy, for his great love, wherewith he loved us,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 9. In this was manifest the love of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>See</hi> v. 10, 11. <hi>yea, and</hi> v. 8. 16. <hi>God is love, he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him.</hi> And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 11. He is called <hi>the God of Love and Peace,</hi> as the original thereof; but this aſſerts no love at all to be in him, either to the World, or to his Elect, either to Angels or to Men, but will ſave ſome, becauſe he will, and damn the reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will: it's a hundred to one (as I ſaid) but that the Devil, had he power to have made a World, might have done as much as this.</p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:61328:111"/>
                  <p>And doubtleſs this Goſpel-deſtroying Doctrin was deviſed to maintain the reprobation of the World by the Eternal Decree, for the apprehenſion of any love to be in God, to men, would end that Principle, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſſible for one that has any goodneſs or love in him, to bring forth an off-ſpring on purpoſe to damn them, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 26, 27, 28, 29. And this the reaſons mentioned; to prove it, does demonſtrate, <hi>viz. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, then, he muſt love the Devil as well as men, and could be no more merciful to thoſe that are ſaved, than to thoſe that are damned, becauſe that which is natural muſt be equal in all its operations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Goodly Arguments to end the love of God to men. 1. Then, doubtleſs, God loved the Devils before they ſinned. 2. As if God could not (from reaſons in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) love Men after they had ſinned, with the love of pity and deſign to do them good, tho' he give us no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his reaſons moving him ſo to do; that he has loved the one and not the other, is a great Scripture truth; the reaſons thereof are in himſelf, and our mercy it is, that it is ſo, let us believe it, and not deny it, leſt he deny us; and for his love to men, that he is capable to love ſome more than others, has been before proved, he loved (and loveth) all, with the love of pity and compaſſion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. and ſuch as believe and obey the Goſpel, with the love of relation and delight, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 21, 23.</p>
                  <p>And to aſſert that which is natural, muſt be equal in all its operations, is neither Divine, nor Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It's not Divine, or Scriptural, for God did (and does) naturally love his Son, (and our Saviour) or he did not, which I am willing to hope, that none are ſo graceleſs as to deny (tho' this Principle does ſo) and

Col.</hi> 1. 13. He loved his people of old, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 7, 8. And he loveth his people now, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 21, 23. Yet not with the ſame love (for meaſure) as he loved and loveth his Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 23.

Iſa. 55. 6, 7. Rev,</hi> 22. 17.</p>
                  <p>By all which it appears, that it is Divine; that God can (and does) not only love, but diſtinguiſh in his love, and not only ſo, but that <hi>he is love,</hi> it is his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 8, 16. And this the Scripture aſſures us of, thereby to confirm us in the truth of his love to men, to his people, and that if we love him, his people and all men, we are therein moſt like him who is love, 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 7, 12. Matth.</hi> 5. 44, 45. And that thoſe who are in the hatred, are moſt like the Devil, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 9, 11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It's irrational. For it's natural for Parents to love their own Children, yet frequently they love ſome more than others, and often on grounded occaſions; and likewiſe to love others, and the like, in varieties of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, there is a lawful difference in natural love, and therefore it's irrational to affirm, that natural love muſt be equal in all its operations, but, I think, it's dangerous to be wiſe, above (and againſt) what is written both in the Book of God, and in the law of Nature, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it tends to pervert and overthrow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Letter and Truth of Scripture, and the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <p>It's a common avowed principle in effect, that God commandeth one thing and has Decreed another, contrary thereunto, which they call his revealed and his ſecret Will; the ſecret they call his Abſolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed Will, which muſt be done, he commands men by his Word to believe and repent, but Decreed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. <hi>Death of Death,</hi> ſaith about the proffers of Grace, <hi>pag. 190.

            <p>WHerein is preſented, 1. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Queries</hi> of weighty concern, relative to the foregoing Diſcourſe. 2. The general and ſpecial (or particular) expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as ſtated in the Scripture, about the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and ſpecial Grace of God to Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Querie</hi> 1. Whether to believe that God reprobated any of Mankind, by an Eternal Decree to ſin and be damned, is not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the whole Scripture (Name and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61328:119"/> of God) in which it's expreſly ſaid, that <hi>he made all Good, Gen.</hi> 1. 31. And that it was ſin brought in (and will bring in) the condemnation, as the deſerving cauſe thereof; and whether we have not grounds to believe it to be impoſſible, for ſo Wiſe, Holy, Juſt and Good a God, to make Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures deſignedly for ſo bad an end? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Principle of Chriſtian Faith, do not deſtroy the very Foundation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel? Being contrary to the whole manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſign of God therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 2. Whether to believe that God loved not the World in the gift of his Son, but a few only? And that Chriſt gave not himſelf for the life of the World, nor a ranſom for all, but for a few only, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not contrary to the expreſs Letter, Reaſon and Scope of the Scripture? <hi>Joh. 6. 51. 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 6. And whether ſo to believe, do not root up the Foundation of Goſpel-Faith? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2. &amp; 15. 3, 4, 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 3. Whether we have not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground to believe, that the general love of God to the World in the gift of his Son,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:61328:119"/> and the general Sacrifice of Chriſt for the World, is the alone Foundation of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Commiſſion for Preaching the Goſpel to the World. If ſo, (it being granted by all, that the Commiſſion, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 15. is general, and ought not to be limited;) then whether to underſtand the Commiſſion for Preaching the Goſpel, to be larger than the Foundation and Baſis thereof, <hi>(viz.</hi> The Fathers Love, and the Sons Sacrifice, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which could have been no ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion) tends not to null and make void the Commiſſion it ſelf, for Goſpel Preaching, it out-running of, and being larger than the Foundation thereof; or at leaſt to render the Lord inconſiderate in ſtating ſo large a Commiſſion on ſo narrow a Foundation? it behoves thoſe who deny the general Love and Sacrifice, to ponder this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 4. Whether to believe, that Men have no power to believe and obey the Goſpel with its own helps, without a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, miraculous and irreſiſtible power, (which God does not effect, and yet will damn Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Eternally for not believing, be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the whole Reaſon, Light and Truth
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61328:120"/> of Scripture? and contrary to the whole Name and Nature of God, and contrary to the whole Light and Law of Nature and Reaſon placed in Man by God. Then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe things are not meet to be explod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all true Chriſtians?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 5. Whether to believe any other terms between the Father and the Son, about the work of Goſpel, Redemption and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, than what are the expreſt terms thereof in the Goſpel, does not tend to null and make void the Goſpel it ſelf? Or at leaſt (and beſt) render it uncertain, if we ſuppoſe any other ſecret terms beſides (and contrary to) what is expreſt, or a ſecret will contrary to his revealed Will.</p>
            <p>

Whether to deny Jeſus Chriſt in his Perſon to be the Son of God and the Son of <hi>David,</hi> the true Meſſias promiſed, and as Crucified, Raiſed and Aſcended, to be the alone Foundation of Goſpel-Faith, head Lord and Lawgiver to his Church, without mens inventions or additions. And whether to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him in Word or Deed in any of theſe, be not deeply dangerous?</p>
            <pb n="211" facs="tcp:61328:120"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 7. Whether to aſſert there is no ſuch thing in God as Love, or a natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to do us Good, from his Goodneſs, or any other property? And that he intends not as he ſpeaketh, either in his precepts or his promiſes, that they declare our Duty, not his intentions, is not wholly contrary to the Scripture? And the Right and Reverend thoughts we ought to have of God. And whether it does not tend to root up the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all Chriſtian Faith and Religion of all hope and truſt in God? And whether it does not really make God a lier, if his Commands and promiſes be not his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 8. Whether to believe that when Chriſt the Lord and Judge of the World comes again from Heaven, to raiſe and Judge the Quick and the Dead, and when that is over, will burn up the World, ſo as not to reſtore it and make it new, and carry away the Saints with him to Heaven, and ſend all the World beſides, to Hell with the Devil, there to be tormented Eternally, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the whole Body of Scripture, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61328:121"/> the Reſtitution, World to come, and the Kingdom and Glory of Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with his Church and the Glory of his great undertaking for the World? And if ſo; Whether this Faith be right or vain?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 9 Whether thoſe who grant the thouſand years reign, and limit the Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, World to come, and the Glory of that Eſtate to the thouſand Years, are not much miſtaken? And whether the Kingdom and Glory of Chriſt and the Saints in the World to come ſhall not be Eternal? <hi>Dan. 7. 14, 27. Mar.</hi> 10. 30. And whether they do well to confine the Eternal Kingdom, Life and Glory, within the compaſs of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years? There being no other World, Life and Glory promiſed, beyond that in the World to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 10. Whether thoſe who grant, that after the Conflagration of the World by fire, that there ſhall be <hi>new Heavens and new Earth follow, wherein dwelleth Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, after the Judgment,</hi> according to the Scripture, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13. And yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61328:121"/> that Chriſt will ſend away all the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the World to Hell with the Devil eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to be tormented, and carry away all the Saints with him to Heaven; (I ſay) whether they have conſidered who ſhall be the inhabitants of this New and Reſtored World, wherein ſhall dwell Righteouſneſs; or whether it ſhall be the habitation (only of Birds and Beaſts) or of nothing? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it it does not concern us prudently to conſider, whether the Traditional Faith of going away to Heaven, has not led us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and ſo (in our Faith) loſt the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and heirſhip promiſed in the World to come?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 11. Whether it is to any ſort of Faith that owns Chriſt in Name, to which the promiſe of Life is made, or to the true Faith and Life of the Goſpel? If to any Faith that owns the Name of Chriſt, then why may not all the World called Chriſtian be ſaved as well as any? If not; but that the Life of the Goſpel is promiſed to the true Faith thereof, (called <hi>the Faith of God</hi>'s <hi>Elect.)</hi> Then whether it does not greatly concern all, without delay, to endeavour to
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:61328:122"/> come right in the Faith and Life of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to which the promiſe is made? And not to content our ſelves with any ſort of Faith and Life?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 12. Whether bad and corrupt Principles of Faith, tho attended with a good life, be not as dangerous and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as good Principles of Faith, attended with a bad life? <hi>Rom. 10. 2. Phi.</hi> 3. 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 13. Whether ſome of thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Faith before mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> the reprobation of the World by Eternal Decree both to ſin and Judgment, does not really tend to render God to be moſt Cruel, moſt Unholy, moſt Unrighteous, and moſt Falſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Decreeing, and ſo in being the firſt and Foundation cauſe, of all the Cruelties, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſs, Unrigheouſneſs, Falſeneſs and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, either in Devils or Men? It being a maxim, that the firſt cauſe of that which is bad, is worſt of all, as a bad Life, has a worſe Heart, becauſe both Words and Works, flow from (and ſhew) the badneſs of the Heart, which is the firſt cauſe. <hi>Mar.</hi> 7. 21,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61328:122"/> 22, 23. And then whether it do not deeply concern men, principally concerned in theſe Notions, ſpeedily to relinquiſh them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 14. And tho probably the perſons concerned in theſe things, may deny ſome of the bad things ſo eſſentially included therein, yet whether it does not very greatly concern them now to conſider, and deeply to ponder, that if to deny one fundamental truth of the Goſpel, namely, that of the Reſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12. did by conſequence, end all Faith and Chriſtian Religion, <hi>verſ,</hi> 13. to 17. tho very probably they intended it not, nor underſtood the dangerous Conſequences couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Opinion, till the Apoſtle informed them therein, then whether to deny (or at beſt, corruptly to hold) almoſt all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtian Faith and Religion, is not more abundantly dangerous to the perſons concerned herein? and whether it concerns not all to look well to themſelves in time, about theſe great matters of Faith, to come right therein, ſeeing no man can rightly claim an intereſt in the grace of life from Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel grounds, whoſe faith is not right in the ſubſtantial things thereof?</p>
            <pb n="216" facs="tcp:61328:123"/>
            <p>And although I take moſt of the things mentioned, to be in themſelves deeply here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, yet I ſhall not paſs the Sentence of Hereticks on thoſe that hold them, nor dare I have ſo foul a Mouth; (let themſelves look to that) I had rather they paſs the Sentence of Heretick on me, than I on them, (tho I deſire neither) becauſe I really deſire the good of all, and I know it will not be to their honour in the end, but I hope I have learned better things from Chriſt; I find none in Scripture ſtigmatized with that foul Name, but <hi>thoſe that denied the Lord that bought them,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 1. and that too, after they had profeſs'd Faith in him; it's a black Name, and let them uſe it that delight in it; I think it's learnt from the great high Prieſt and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate at <hi>Rome,</hi> who ſtigmatizeth all for Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, that believe not as his Church belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth; and well were it, if thoſe who profeſs to be come quite away, did not walk too much in the ſame ſteps.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 15. Whether we have not cauſe well to conſider, whether thoſe manifold and great Miſcarriages, in the greateſt matters of the Goſpel, ariſe not very much from Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:61328:123"/> Receptions from Forefathers? by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which our Eyes are blinded, that we cannot ſee into the great and plain things of the Goſpel, it being moſt apparent, that not only the <hi>Jews</hi> in general (but the better ſort of them, even the Diſciples of Chriſt) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by tradition, that Chriſt was to come as a King, <hi>to reſtore the Kingdom to</hi> Iſrael, (which was a truth in it ſelf, and ſhall be effected at his next coming) by reaſon of which, they underſtood not his firſt coming and ſuffering in order thereunto; nor could they believe it, being blinded by their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer received Notion, (tho true in it ſelf,) <hi>viz.</hi> that he ſhould reign, but not ſuffer, tho Chriſt inſtructed them therein (at leaſt) three times; and if it be ſo, that the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one truth may (through corruption) blind perſons in another part of truth, (which I fear is too common) Whether it do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us all to look well to our ſelves in this matter? leſt we for ever miſs of truth, and ſpend our time and ſtrength to maintain our Traditional Receptions (the devices of others that have gone before us) directly contrary to the Word of Truth, and ſo endanger to loſe our ſelves eternally.</p>

               <hi>Quer.</hi> 16. Finally, Whether thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that exhorts us <hi>to lay up our treaſure in Heaven, and that the inheritance is reſerved in heaven for</hi> believers, will not all be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <hi>in the new</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>that ſhall come down from God out of Heaven,</hi> and Heaven ſhall be on Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> in the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the new Earth and World? And ſo the Scriptures ſtand in unity in this matter; and <hi>Peter</hi> explains it, 1. <hi>Pet. 1. 5.
